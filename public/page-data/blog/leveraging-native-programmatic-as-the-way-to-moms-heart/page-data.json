For Mother’s Day in particular, that may be a buyer&#8217;s guides, or tips for creating a special day, etc. Native inventory enables marketers to deliver messages outside of the historical formats where readers are typically not paying attention. What&#8217;s more, since seasonal campaigns like Mother’s Day can be influenced by real-time news and events, it&#8217;s easy to update and tweak native creative to react to external circumstances.</p>\n<p>To implement a native programmatic strategy, first and foremost, the message should be contextually relevant to the site its on.  Be sure the websites you run on are in line with your product or service to make your Mother’s Day campaign feel like a natural addition to the site.</p>\n<p>Of course it&#8217;s also important to combine seasonal targeting insights with contextual and psychographic data. Ask yourself questions your data can answer &#8211; Did you consumers show a pattern of buying flowers or chocolates?  Are they searching for gift ideas more this time of year? And don&#8217;t forget to leverage gender categories to find the right audience, or target users who have historically made relevant seasonal purchases.</p>\n<p>Native programmatic is bringing credibility back to digital and creating an opportunity for marketers to execute branding campaigns which give them a beautiful canvas to tell their story – and do so in the most cost-efficient way possible.  Now that’s something even a Mother can love.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\t\t</p>\n","title":"Leveraging Native Programmatic as the Way to Mom’s Heart","uri":"/blog/leveraging-native-programmatic-as-the-way-to-moms-heart/","date":"April 15, 2015","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0Nw==","name":"ad tech"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0OA==","name":"ads"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0OQ==","name":"advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1MA==","name":"agencies"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2Mw==","name":"brand marketing"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo4MA==","name":"Branding"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1MQ==","name":"content marketing"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Mg==","name":"digital advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Mw==","name":"digital marketing"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1NA==","name":"Digital Media"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2NA==","name":"display advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo5NA==","name":"holidays"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1NQ==","name":"marketing"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMzY=","name":"Mother's Day"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Ng==","name":"native"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Nw==","name":"native ads"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OA==","name":"Native advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OQ==","name":"nativeadvertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2MA==","name":"online"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo3Mg==","name":"programmatic"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2Ng==","name":"research"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo3Mw==","name":"RTB"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMzc=","name":"seasonality"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/34f7ee73d07f418a1d6bf08380e6280f/b9373/Happy-Mothers-Day-2012-HD-wallpaper-2.jpg","srcSet":"/static/34f7ee73d07f418a1d6bf08380e6280f/18e68/Happy-Mothers-Day-2012-HD-wallpaper-2.jpg 250w,\n/static/34f7ee73d07f418a1d6bf08380e6280f/5d511/Happy-Mothers-Day-2012-HD-wallpaper-2.jpg 500w,\n/static/34f7ee73d07f418a1d6bf08380e6280f/b9373/Happy-Mothers-Day-2012-HD-wallpaper-2.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/34f7ee73d07f418a1d6bf08380e6280f/6c608/Happy-Mothers-Day-2012-HD-wallpaper-2.avif 250w,\n/static/34f7ee73d07f418a1d6bf08380e6280f/bfc4a/Happy-Mothers-Day-2012-HD-wallpaper-2.avif 500w,\n/static/34f7ee73d07f418a1d6bf08380e6280f/0cf21/Happy-Mothers-Day-2012-HD-wallpaper-2.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/34f7ee73d07f418a1d6bf08380e6280f/f4686/Happy-Mothers-Day-2012-HD-wallpaper-2.webp 250w,\n/static/34f7ee73d07f418a1d6bf08380e6280f/af5c2/Happy-Mothers-Day-2012-HD-wallpaper-2.webp 500w,\n/static/34f7ee73d07f418a1d6bf08380e6280f/b0ac1/Happy-Mothers-Day-2012-HD-wallpaper-2.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":666}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)};
