Check out our infographic that tracks industry trends of how much consumers spend on gifts, and when and where they shop most for the holiday.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mothers-day-consumer-shopping-trends-2019-infographic.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4144\" src=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/mothers-day-consumer-shopping-trends-2019-infographic.png\" alt=\"Mother's Day Consumer Shopping Trends 2019 Infographic\" width=\"2550\" height=\"15495\" /></a></p>\n<h4><b>Recommendations for Brands</b></h4>\n<p>As brands and agencies enter the buying season for Mother’s Day, here are important things to keep in mind for developing campaigns that successfully drive both awareness and purchases.</p>\n<h4><b>Keep Targeting Highly Personal</b></h4>\n<p>Targeting for this holiday will come down to two major factors: age group and what they value. For example, if you’re targeting Millennials and Generation Z, keep in mind the platforms and publishers where they spend the most time, but also the fact that 45% of 18 to 34-year olds plan on <a href=\"https://nrf.com/insights/holiday-and-seasonal-trends/mothers-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">giving experience gifts</a> like trips, concerts, and memberships. Because every age group will be actively purchasing for Mother’s Day, your campaigns should consider where each group consumes content and what they are most likely to purchase.</p>\n<h4><b>Amplify storytelling with your formats.</b></h4>\n<p>Run-of-the-mill ads will do you no favors when it comes to sentimental, personal holidays like Mother’s Day. Brands can stand out by focusing on compelling stories that evoke emotions of love, gratitude, and gratefulness. Ad formats like <a href=\"/formats/#branded-vid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">branded video</a>, <a href=\"/formats/#cinemagraph\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cinemagraph</a>, and <a href=\"/formats/#carousel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">carousel</a> that integrate motion and interactivity can give you more room for creating compelling stories.</p>\n<h4><b>Mirror Your Schedule to Spending Habits</b></h4>\n<p>Over 13% of shoppers <a href=\"https://www.yieldify.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/mothers-day-marketing-2018-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">start as early as a month before</a> the holiday, more than a quarter of shoppers start two weeks ahead of the holiday, and nearly 50% complete their shopping within 24 hours before the big day. Your creative messaging may shift accordingly from “buy early” calls to action to “get those last minute gifts now.” And so will your campaign goals: Early shoppers may purchase successfully online, while late shoppers will need help accessing nearby physical locations to purchase gifts for their loved ones. Early planning will ensure you make the most of the Mother’s Day buying season.\t\t</p>\n","title":"How Advertisers Can Help Mom Get All the Attention She Deserves ","uri":"/blog/mothers-day-infographic-shopping-trends/","date":"April 23, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMzY=","name":"Mother's Day"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMDM=","name":"Native Awards"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c5c0efc60eafb8e2b466239f1802e9dd/69209/042319_MothersDay.jpg","srcSet":"/static/c5c0efc60eafb8e2b466239f1802e9dd/e9e8b/042319_MothersDay.jpg 250w,\n/static/c5c0efc60eafb8e2b466239f1802e9dd/84742/042319_MothersDay.jpg 500w,\n/static/c5c0efc60eafb8e2b466239f1802e9dd/69209/042319_MothersDay.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/c5c0efc60eafb8e2b466239f1802e9dd/98dbc/042319_MothersDay.avif 250w,\n/static/c5c0efc60eafb8e2b466239f1802e9dd/92e1f/042319_MothersDay.avif 500w,\n/static/c5c0efc60eafb8e2b466239f1802e9dd/9b3e4/042319_MothersDay.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/c5c0efc60eafb8e2b466239f1802e9dd/0b151/042319_MothersDay.webp 250w,\n/static/c5c0efc60eafb8e2b466239f1802e9dd/33dd0/042319_MothersDay.webp 500w,\n/static/c5c0efc60eafb8e2b466239f1802e9dd/6429b/042319_MothersDay.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/how-will-post-cookie-world-affect-programmatic-advertising/","title":"TripleLift In the News: How Will a Post-Cookie World Affect Programmatic Advertising?"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/state-of-mobile-advertising-2019/","title":"The State of Mobile Advertising & What’s Ahead for 2019"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo0MTM5","previousPostId":"cG9zdDo0MTYy","nextPostId":"cG9zdDo0MDE3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
