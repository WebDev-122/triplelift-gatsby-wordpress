href=\"https://www.iab.net/consumerview\">IAB and Edelman</a> surveyed over 5,000 consumers to get their opinions on native advertising.   According to the results, relevant and meaningful in-feed, sponsored content that tells a story was the most important factor for making an ad a success.  The take-away?  Consumers prefer native advertising.  Now, a new study is validating the results seen in the research conducted by the IAB.</p>\n<p>A new report by the Association of Online Publishers (AOP), <i>The Power of Native</i>, finds that attitudes towards native advertising are positive, with three in five (59%) consumers claiming to find native advertising ‘interesting’.  When compared to traditional advertising, 42% more consumers find native ad drivers interesting and twice as many find them informative.  This is similar to how <a href=\"https://navigatingnative.com/2014/07/key-takeaways-from-iab-native-research/\">consumers responded within the IAB study</a>, where they found native more appealing and less annoying that other forms of digital advertising.</p>\n<p>Another similarity to the IAB study, the AOP study finds that native advertising garners greater levels of trust among consumers with a third (33%) more likely to trust native advertising than traditional advertising.  The IAB likely found that brands see an increase in trust with native.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the report found that clicking on a native ad on a premium content website has greater impact than clicking via Facebook.  There’s something advertisers can certainly like.\t\t</p>\n","title":"Another Study
