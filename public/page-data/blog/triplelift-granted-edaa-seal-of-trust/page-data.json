Their main purpose is to provide companies involved in data-driven advertising across Europe the ‘AdChoices Icon’, a symbol that provides consumers with easy-to-understand information about data-driven advertising as well as sharing information they need to make an informed choice about personalised ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why the EDAA Trust Seal Matters</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift has undergone a thorough certification process to validate that 100% of our native, video, and display ads are compliant with industry standards for the collection and use of OBA user data, in agreement with the EDAA policies and practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trust Seal showcases our commitment to bring trust and transparency to the industry, in addition to giving consumers complete control and access to their user data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being granted the EDAA certification is one of the many initiatives we are a part of to boost transparency in the digital industry.
