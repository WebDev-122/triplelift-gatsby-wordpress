The last thing you should have to worry about is the quality and safety of your media placements. But depending on who you’re buying from, that’s likely your biggest concern.&nbsp; At TripleLift, we hold our media to higher standards, so we created the Triple Lock Promise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Zero Resold Impressions</strong><br><br>Media dollars should go to media, not resellers. Bidding on directly sourced inventory increases your win rate by 4x while decreasing your CPM by at least 25%.&nbsp; That is why our 36 Billion daily impressions are sourced directly from publishers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lowest Industry Fraud Rate</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we scan for fraud before the bid, our inventory is 99.6% pure. While we know that there are super savvy criminals that stay one step ahead of the industry, we humbly brag that we have the lowest fraud rate in the industry (0.4% according to White Ops).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>No Misinformation Sites</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe in the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so we’ve partnered with NewsGuard to ensure your media dollars only go to credible sources. By removing sites from our platform that have been flagged for misinformation, hate speech and other malicious content we don’t fund bad actors…and neither will you.Since we built our inventory from the ground up, we don&#8217;t need any of the gimmicks that help other exchanges get their scale. Our inventory is clean and our aim is true. <br><br>To learn more about TripleLift and our Triple Lock Promise, ping us at <a href=\"mailto:partners@triplelift.com\">partners@triplelift.com</a></p>\n","title":"TripleLift Triple Lock Promise","uri":"/blog/triple-lock-promise/","date":"August 05, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"TripleLock Promise","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f7ef3f52e3fed87966c939b3a9ebc65d/69209/TL_TripleLock_blog_1024x1024-1-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/f7ef3f52e3fed87966c939b3a9ebc65d/e9e8b/TL_TripleLock_blog_1024x1024-1-1.jpg 250w,\n/static/f7ef3f52e3fed87966c939b3a9ebc65d/84742/TL_TripleLock_blog_1024x1024-1-1.jpg 500w,\n/static/f7ef3f52e3fed87966c939b3a9ebc65d/69209/TL_TripleLock_blog_1024x1024-1-1.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/f7ef3f52e3fed87966c939b3a9ebc65d/98dbc/TL_TripleLock_blog_1024x1024-1-1.avif 250w,\n/static/f7ef3f52e3fed87966c939b3a9ebc65d/92e1f/TL_TripleLock_blog_1024x1024-1-1.avif 500w,\n/static/f7ef3f52e3fed87966c939b3a9ebc65d/9b3e4/TL_TripleLock_blog_1024x1024-1-1.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/f7ef3f52e3fed87966c939b3a9ebc65d/0b151/TL_TripleLock_blog_1024x1024-1-1.webp 250w,\n/static/f7ef3f52e3fed87966c939b3a9ebc65d/33dd0/TL_TripleLock_blog_1024x1024-1-1.webp 500w,\n/static/f7ef3f52e3fed87966c939b3a9ebc65d/6429b/TL_TripleLock_blog_1024x1024-1-1.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/success-stories-women-cafemedia/","title":"Success Stories From Women at the Top: CafeMedia’s Shobha Doshi"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/direct-exchange/","title":"TripleLift is the Direct Exchange "}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNjQ5NA==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNTY4MQ==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNjQ5Mw=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
