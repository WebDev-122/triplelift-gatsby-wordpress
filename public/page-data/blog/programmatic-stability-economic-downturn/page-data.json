Whether the virus sparks a complete downturn or temporary correction is unclear, but due to the inextricable link between consumer spending and advertising, the media community’s shared anxiety is growing daily.</p>\n<p>However, there’s reason for the programmatic advertising sector to anticipate stability. Programmatically transactable digital media – and the companies that power it ­– has a few defining characteristics that suggest it would fare better in challenging times. Advertisers should take note.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, during times of instability, we can expect a flight to accountability, agility and continuity.</p>\n<p><b>Accountability</b></p>\n<p>While programmatic occupies a larger section of the marketing funnel, it is still primarily a highly targeted, mid- to lower-funnel protocol frequently used for direct response campaigns that align with last-touch attribution. This manner relies less on the speculative nature of branding and more on the data-driven, outcome-based formula that feeds programmatic algorithms industrywide.</p>\n<p>When results can be so cleanly tied to spend, that spend should continue to be justifiable, even in a downturn.</p>\n<p>And as brands look for cost-savings, one of the first places they look is their agencies. One more forward-thinking move is for brands to invest in and take more control of their programmatic strategy and budgets to save costs and invest in a more efficient form of media. This could have ripple effects downstream that also benefit the programmatic entities that power those transactions.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/in-the-face-of-an-economic-downturn-programmatic-may-be-well-positioned/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Continue reading the full article on AdExchanger here</a>.&nbsp; </strong></p>\n","title":"In the Face of an Economic Downturn, Programmatic May Be Well Positioned","uri":"/blog/programmatic-stability-economic-downturn/","date":"March 17, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0OQ==","name":"advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo3Mg==","name":"programmatic"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"In the Face of An Economic Downturn, Programmatic May Be Well-Positioned","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/1ec4e/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.png","srcSet":"/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/5add7/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.png 250w,\n/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/aef42/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.png 500w,\n/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/1ec4e/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/98dbc/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.avif 250w,\n/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/92e1f/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.avif 500w,\n/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/1b94f/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/0b151/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.webp 250w,\n/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/33dd0/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.webp 500w,\n/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/589ec/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":998.9999999999999}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/prepared-for-change/","title":"Our Operational Plan: The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/10-tips-working-remotely/","title":"10 Tips to Make the Most of Working Remotely"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNDUwMg==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDU2MQ==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDQzMg=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
