Every month we share an interview with one of our publisher partners, highlighting unique stories and uncovering valuable insights. This month, we are featuring a two-part spotlight with <a href=\"/blog/a-nickels-worth-of-freestar-advice-insights-from-ceo-kurt-donnell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Freestar’s CEO, Kurt Donnell. In Part 1, Donnell offered readers an inside look at </a>Freestar’s impressive growth, what attracted him to the company and how his team remains devoted to client satisfaction. Now, Donnell shares how the Freestar team is navigating<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurtdonnell/\"> </a>industry challenges, what publishers should be considering when it comes to video and gives us a sneak peek at what’s ahead for the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From all appearances, Freestar’s publishers are thrilled to be working with you &#8211; what do you think they would say is the best part of your partnership?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of companies can offer similar technology to ours, but the service and the custom solutions that we offer are truly unmatched in the industry. As much as we will continue to iterate and innovate on our tech and products, I feel that our publishers would overwhelmingly say our best feature is our team, which is very intentional. I firmly believe that if you take care of your employees and take care of your customers, a lot of other things will take care of themselves. Accordingly, we start with our employees and constantly push ourselves to give them what they need to be successful which in turn lets them better serve our clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a company, we understand that we will always be a client-facing organization first and foremost, and it shows in our day-to-day internal interactions. One of our most active Slack channels (which happens to be my personal favorite) is our NPS channel where the whole company gets real-time, unfiltered feedback from our publishers when responses to our monthly NPS survey are submitted. It is always so great to see people across every team in the organization come together to celebrate and/or learn whenever we have new responses come in from publishers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The industry faces immense change with the imminent death of the third-party cookie, Apple&#8217;s iOS 14 update, and a myriad of new state-led privacy regulations. How can publishers best prepare for these changes? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone that has been in this industry over the years, we all understand the only real constant is change and that every three months or so there will be something new to address. GDPR, CCPA, and the other U.S. states to follow &#8211; and potentially federal mandates &#8211; are just one element of the change in consumer protections. Add in the third-party cookies and IDFA changes and publishers rightly have a lot to be thinking about, however we as an industry have always found ways to address changes and challenges, and this will be no different. While I don’t know that anyone can definitively say what the solution will be to address the lack of third-party cookies, there are already so many different solutions being tested that I have no doubt there will be viable options that meet the needs of publishers and advertisers alike.<br><br>For a single publisher, who is handling all of their ad tech in-house, I’d recommend trying to test as many targeting solutions as possible in 2021 and staying up-to-date on the future of privacy and the demise of the third-party cookie through the various industry resources (such as AdExchanger, Digiday, eMarketer, AdWeek to name a few). There is also no shortage of online webinars that cover the various changes in the industry. Finally, I encourage publishers to join the conversation when possible through groups like IAB or Prebid.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With regard to privacy compliance, it is important for publishers to vet their Consent Management Platform (CMP) provider thoroughly and remember that you often get what you pay for. A free tool simply cannot offer you the same service as a solution you pay for. As a self-proclaimed “recovering attorney”, I would also be remiss if I didn’t suggest you seek the advice of counsel on anything you do or implement on your site that is compliance-related.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For publishers, e-commerce companies, or app developers that don’t want to go it alone, ad management companies like Freestar can often help mitigate the headaches of addressing the ever changing world of ad tech (in addition to increasing revenue!). As ad tech is all we do, targeting, compliance and all of the other nuances of our crazy industry are challenges we work to solve all day every day on behalf of our clients so they don’t have to. But I am admittedly a bit biased on this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In the last year, we&#8217;ve witnessed an acceleration in the demand for premium video inventory across all formats. In-app and in-feed are no exception. Are there any trends or insights that Freestar has uncovered that publishers should consider when looking to increase yield as it relates to video? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I like to encourage publishers to do is to add video and video advertising opportunities to their site without monetization being the sole purpose behind the initiative. We always take a balanced approach with our publishers around user experience and revenue, and that is especially important with video products. Video products in the right place at the right time will not only drive better revenue, but will also keep your users coming back and consuming more content &#8211; which ultimately is what we all want for the health of the open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any sneak peaks of advancements that either publishers or advertisers should be looking out for in the coming months?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are working toward offering a number of unique ad unit experiences that will be available exclusively for direct-sold and PMP deals. As we continue to grow that piece of our business, we want to ensure we offer both publishers and advertisers unique solutions that meet their needs. We also will continue to add new features and support for additional ad units and integration types to our app monetization platform that is very unique in the ad management space. Lastly, we will continue to build on our Ideal Ad Stack technology to ensure we optimize the value of every ad impression we manage for our publishers. Ultimately, we remain committed to building products that further cement Freestar as the one-stop shop for publishers, e-commerce sites, app developers and advertisers who want to optimize revenue and performance.</p>\n","title":"Part 2 : A Nickel’s Worth of Freestar Advice, Insights from CEO Kurt Donnell","uri":"/blog/a-nickels-worth-of-freestar-advice-insights-from-ceo-kurt-donnell-part2/","date":"March 30, 2021","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.png","srcSet":"/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/5add7/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.png 250w,\n/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/aef42/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.png 500w,\n/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/98dbc/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.avif 250w,\n/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/92e1f/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.avif 500w,\n/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/9b3e4/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/0b151/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.webp 250w,\n/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/33dd0/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.webp 500w,\n/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/6429b/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDozMTU0MA==","excerpt":"<p>The following email was sent to all TripleLift employees immediately following an all-hands meeting where Co-Founder and CEO Eric Berry announced the acquisition of the company by Vista Equity Partners.&nbsp; TripleLift announced today that a majority stake of the company will be acquired by Vista Equity Partners, a leading private equity firm focused on software, [&hellip;]</p>\n","content":"\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The following email was sent to all TripleLift employees immediately following an all-hands meeting where Co-Founder and CEO Eric Berry announced the acquisition of the company by Vista Equity Partners.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift announced today that a majority stake of the company will be acquired by Vista Equity Partners, a leading private equity firm focused on software, data and technology-enabled businesses. Vista’s involvement will accelerate global growth and further drive product innovation for TripleLift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the largest transactions in the history of ad tech and a wonderful outcome for our company, our shareholders and our employees. This alignment will also create positive effects for our customers and partners as it provides us with the ability to service them in an increasing number of ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me provide some details about this agreement, explain why we entered into it, articulate what it means to our future and share what comes next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the details of this investment?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift has been acquired by Vista Equity Partners. This should be a moment of pride for every TripleLifter past and present. We started the business in 2012 with a central idea to bring Native ads to the open web. Through your hard work, we have delivered on that original thesis, expanded to become a large and well regarded programmatic exchange, and have begun commercializing a truly differentiated CTV business. These three chapters of our company’s history &#8211; and our ability to demonstrate proficiency in each one of them &#8211; is what created the value leading to this transaction. TripleLift and Vista will be working together to evaluate key drivers for successful growth moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why did we make this decision?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift has grown over 70% annually since 2015, and we are committed to building on our leadership position going forward. This acquisition ensures that we are well capitalized to follow through on our strategic plan:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Maintaining our leadership position in Native</li><li>Expanding our position in programmatic video where we are a Top 3 provider</li><li>Catalyzing our opportunity in CTV</li><li>Further expanding into priority international markets across Europe &amp; Asia</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Vista is a value-added investor with an extensive track record of helping companies achieve excellence by contributing professional expertise and proven best practices. They will be a powerful resource as we move into this next chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What does the acquisition mean?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the highest level, let me start with the old adage: “the more things change, the more they stay the same.” Vista made this investment in TripleLift for the growth opportunity ahead of us. They bought us for our strategy, our priorities, our brand and our values. None of that changes. As we always have, we will revisit our plans as market circumstances dictate, but we will now have those discussions with Vista instead of our current board of directors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike Fosnaugh, the Co-Head of the Flagship Fund at Vista remarked to me the other day: “Your team has built something extraordinary. Our goal is to help you reach the goals we’ve been discussing. We will help you grow into your ambitions, not change what you’ve built.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We anticipate that the deal will officially close in Q2 2021, once government regulators have had a chance to review the acquisition. Until and beyond that point, it is business as usual. We’ve got an industry to keep changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone on this team for living our values and driving us to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric</p>\n","title":"TripleLift Acquired by Vista Equity Partners","uri":"/blog/triplelift-acquired-by-vista-equity-partners/","date":"March 29, 2021","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/8f3c3/TripleLift-Logo.png","srcSet":"/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/5add7/TripleLift-Logo.png 250w,\n/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/aef42/TripleLift-Logo.png 500w,\n/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/8f3c3/TripleLift-Logo.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/98dbc/TripleLift-Logo.avif 250w,\n/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/92e1f/TripleLift-Logo.avif 500w,\n/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/9b3e4/TripleLift-Logo.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/0b151/TripleLift-Logo.webp 250w,\n/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/33dd0/TripleLift-Logo.webp 500w,\n/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/6429b/TripleLift-Logo.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDozMTUyNA==","excerpt":"<p>Welcome to TripleLift’s Publisher Spotlight Series.

Read on for Kurt’s insight on Freestar’s impressive growth, what attracted him to the company, and what it takes to remain devoted to client satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thank you for speaking with us! Can you tell us about your role at Freestar?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me. It has been a pleasure working with TripleLift over the years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My role as President and CEO has continued to evolve since I joined the company in January 2019. When I started with the company, we were still under 30 people and needed to build or formalize a lot of areas of the business from both a systems and employee standpoint. In the first year or so, I spent a lot of time working to ensure we had a scalable foundation in place for some more basic things like accounting and HR and automated a number of time-intensive processes. I also was hyper-focused on building a very customer service-oriented business, both from a culture standpoint and hiring the right teams, which has paid dividends as evidenced by our NPS scores that are consistently above 70 on a monthly basis. Of course helping to chart the long term vision and direction of the business has been a huge priority since day one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we have continued to grow, now over 75 employees, my focus has shifted a bit more to hiring, team structure and leadership development. I always want to ensure we have the right people in the right roles, and that they have the bandwidth and tools to execute at a high level. Accordingly, I spend a lot of time with employees at all levels of our organization to understand and alleviate their pain points and do a lot of work with our management group to encourage accountability and ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What attracted you to the company?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With regard to what brought me to Freestar, I met the founders of Freestar early in their journey and almost joined them 2 years before I eventually did. Perhaps foolishly, I decided to go another direction and joined YogaWorks as EVP of Partnerships and General Counsel where I had the chance to help the company through its IPO and significant growth through acquisitions. Throughout my time at YogaWorks, I stayed in touch with the Freestar founders and was continually impressed with what they were doing and the way they were doing it. I also realized I missed the constant change and need to adapt in the world of ad tech, so it was an incredibly easy decision when the founders asked if I would be interested in coming on board to help lead the next stage of growth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to join the company when I did was truly a blessing. There were already so many good bones in place, we just needed some operational and administrative improvements that we have thankfully been able to implement. The last two years have undoubtedly been the most fulfilling of my career and it truly feels like we are just getting started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Freestar has seen unbelievable growth over the past few years. How has the company changed since you first started?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have certainly changed a lot from a headcount standpoint in the last couple years, tripling in size and hiring 39 new employees in 2020 alone. During that time we went from having offices in Phoenix (our headquarters), New York and Los Angeles to a majority remote team in 2019 when we shifted our focus to hiring the very best people, no matter where they were located. Our early adoption of remote culture unknowingly set us up incredibly well to become a fully-remote company in 2020, which we plan to continue indefinitely.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With our decision to hire employees outside of cities with offices, we had to evolve our culture to ensure that we were still growing incredible employees despite not seeing them daily. We instituted a number of things in 2019, like full company offsites, which we have since switched to very successful virtual retreats in 2020, an ongoing monthly speaker series, new women’s and diversity committees, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major change was weaving our obsession with client satisfaction into everything we do. Much of our success &#8211; such as being the number 1 fastest growing company on the 2019 Inc. 5000 list which we followed up with a number 36 ranking in 2020 &#8211; has been driven by retention and growth of existing customers, not just new customers. We spend a ton of time and energy to improve our processes and we never allow ourselves to rest on our laurels. Be it increasing headcount on our client success team, improving our external dashboard, building new ad products or making upgrades to internal systems, we always strive to get 1% better each week and make our customer’s experiences with us remarkable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We&#8217;ve all learned over the past year that prioritizing mental health is important. What are some of the things you&#8217;ve been doing lately when you need to take a break?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no denying that the pandemic has taken a toll on all of us in a myriad of ways. While working from home certainly has its perks, it is very easy to instantly be at your desk when you wake up in the morning and find yourself there until well after dinner time. As a result, my team and I have taken a deeper look at our home office lives and have been trying to set the example that getting outside and taking mental health breaks is important. I personally make it a point to try to walk or hike most days of the week, squeeze in golf whenever I can, and take road trips to get a change of scenery while flying has been out of the picture. Like most companies, we have also been extra flexible for our employees with children, allowing them to work schedules that match up with the needs of their family which is ultimately the most important thing in their life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/blog/a-nickels-worth-of-freestar-advice-insights-from-ceo-kurt-donnell-part2/\">Click here for part 2 of our conversation with Freestar’s CEO, Kurt Donnell.</a></p>\n","title":"A Nickel’s Worth of Freestar Advice: Insights from CEO Kurt Donnell","uri":"/blog/a-nickels-worth-of-freestar-advice-insights-from-ceo-kurt-donnell/","date":"March 24, 2021","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.png","srcSet":"/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/5add7/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.png 250w,\n/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/aef42/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.png 500w,\n/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/98dbc/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.avif 250w,\n/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/92e1f/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.avif 500w,\n/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/9b3e4/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/0b151/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.webp 250w,\n/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/33dd0/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.webp 500w,\n/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/6429b/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}}]}}}
