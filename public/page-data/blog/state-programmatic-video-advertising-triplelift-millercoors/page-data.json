With so many video formats and programmatic approaches, it’s important for advertisers to understand the nuances of each and how they can be used to deliver against your brand objectives — and then develop a strategy that reflects that.</p>\n<p>TripleLift’s <b>Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer Ari Lewine</b> kicked off the event by sharing his insights for creating an effective programmatic video strategy. Then, <b>Megan Sullivan, Manager of Marketing Data Strategy, MillerCoors</b> joined to discuss the tactics that brands can use to deliver results.</p>\n<p>In this video, you’ll get an insider understanding of how the convergence of OTT, CTA and Pre-Roll has changed the way brands think about the new video ecosystem, the biggest capabilities and challenges of OTT inventory today, the most important tactics ad tech partners should employ, and why it’s critical that creative be designed specifically for the media channel where it will run.</p>\n<p>Watch the full discussion below and hear what’s on the rise for video in 2020.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"State of Programmatic Video Breakfast with TripleLift &amp; MillerCoors\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-CnL1cgnPqw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h5><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below, see takeaways from the discussion.</span></h5>\n<p><strong><i>What does today’s programmatic operating model look like for a client, and where do we see it going?</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important for clients to consider a decentralized approach by refining their list of direct relationships with DSP partners. A refined list of partners will help streamline efficient communication from brand strategy, media planning and activation.</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>How has the agency model evolved as programmatic continues to become the way that all media is transacted?</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As all media channels converge from traditional platforms to programmatic, the most important task will always be coordination. Agency teams will continue to be at the center of this process and will be vital in leading this coordination between clients and ad tech partners.</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>How has the way brands think about the new video ecosystem changed now that OTT, CTV and Pre-roll converge?&nbsp;</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key first step is for an organization to level set internally and ensure all teams are using the same vocabulary when defining video. From there, it is important to create best practices that align with key video success metrics (CPCV, VCR, Viewability etc.). Lastly, develop an approach where each video channel is aligned with specific brands, based on how well it can achieve specific KPIs that include both online and offline metrics.</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>What are the capabilities and challenges of OTT inventory as it stands today?</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main challenge advertisers face today is the amount of OTT players in the space. That’s a good thing because it means it’s working and worth your ad spend. However, the drawback is the amount of time that goes into testing and learning what drives best performance, which inventory has the most scale, and available targeting capabilities. Once those capabilities are more defined, it will be a clearer process from start to finish. Our industry will get there, because the consumers are already there. It will just take time, so patience is key.</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>How is creative development being refined today now that there are new video inventory sources available outside of traditional TV ads?</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important for the creative to be designed specifically for the media channel it will be running on. For instance, a 30-second or 15-second TV or pre-roll spot will not have the same impact in environments that lend themselves to streaming long-form content in the OTT space. At the same time, in environments where earning consumer attention needs to be quick and precise, a 6-second video ad could perform best on a mobile device.</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>What is one of the most important tactics for Ad Tech partners to consider when working with brands in the programmatic video world?</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always remember that brands take time to develop a thoughtful, cohesive strategy and tech stack where all elements are supposed to work together through a specific process. Ad Tech partners that can seamlessly integrate with a client’s existing DSP or DMP partners will have a key advantage in the space. This approach only allows for more opportunities to test, learn and develop best practices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>What is on the rise for 2020 that marketers should be focused on?</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will be imperative for advertisers to learn how to identify opportunities that can help them scale campaigns effectively beyond the walled gardens. To do this, it will be incredibly important to diversify your media spend while also ensuring high-quality inventory sources are being included in your media strategy to drive efficiencies.</span></p>\n","title":"State of Programmatic Video: Tactical Advice for Advertisers from TripleLift & MillerCoors ","uri":"/blog/state-programmatic-video-advertising-triplelift-millercoors/","date":"July 29, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMjM=","name":"Branded Video"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNzE=","name":"Outstream"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxOTU=","name":"Video Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/69209/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/e9e8b/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.jpg 250w,\n/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/84742/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.jpg 500w,\n/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/69209/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/98dbc/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.avif 250w,\n/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/92e1f/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.avif 500w,\n/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/9b3e4/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/0b151/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.webp 250w,\n/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/33dd0/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.webp 500w,\n/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/6429b/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/triplelift-exchange-first-price-auction/","title":"TripleLift Moves to First Price Auctions"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/branded-video-advertising-engagement-eye-tracking-study/","title":"Eye Tracking Study Reveals the Video Ads That Actually Get Viewed & Why"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo0MzE2","previousPostId":"cG9zdDo0MzM5","nextPostId":"cG9zdDo0Mjkz"}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
