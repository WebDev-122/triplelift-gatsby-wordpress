Together, we call this technology our “Platform.” It is a platform because it provides underlying technology on top of which our clients and partners can run and build their own businesses. The Platform helps facilitate the buying and selling of ads that you see online such as in web pages, apps, and video content. Selling ads helps publishers of digital content – from one-person blogs to major media companies – generate revenue to support that content, and it helps advertisers – from the smallest local businesses to the largest global brands – reach customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Platform uses information about internet users and devices. Some of this information may be considered personal information (or personal data). Our customers and other third parties may use or interact with our Platform, and when they do, they are subject to contractual terms and other limitations we have put in place.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cookies are small bits of information that we are able to store in your web browser.
