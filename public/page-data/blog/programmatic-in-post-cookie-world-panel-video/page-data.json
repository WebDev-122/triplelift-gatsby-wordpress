The panel occurred on the heels of rumors that Google would be making significant changes to consumer privacy within Chrome in the form of blocking or limiting third-party cookies. On May 7, 2019, Chrome substantiated some of those rumors with an </span><a href=\"https://blog.chromium.org/2019/05/improving-privacy-and-security-on-web.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">announcement</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> about its proposed changes that would enable consumers’ control over cookies and tracking. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The programmatic ecosystem is fundamentally changing in real time, so we gathered a set of industry thought leaders from across the ecosystem to discuss what the impact will be and how publishers and advertisers can prepare themselves. Our panel featured host </span><b>Ronan Shields</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of <em>Adweek</em>, and panelists included </span><b>Michael Balabanov</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, SVP, Sales &#8211; North America, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Guardian News &amp; Media; </span></i><b>Travis Clinger</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, VP of Strategic Initiatives, Live Ramp; </span><b>Joella Duncan</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Director of Media Strategy, Equifax; </span><b>Ari Paparo</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Founder &amp; CEO, Beeswax;  and </span><b>Jay Wells</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Sr. Director Strategy &amp; Planning, Merkle. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main message from the panel? This is a time to pivot. Our panelists shared how Firefox’s ETP and Safari’s ITP impacted their ad performance, what the Chrome changes really mean, the targeting tactics that are set to win and lose, and how their businesses are changing their advertising strategies. They also reveal each of their predictions of what the role of the third-party cookie will be in the future.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watch the full discussion below!</span></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"TripleLift&#039;s &#039;Programmatic in a Post-Cookie World&#039; Panel\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/osaVtRDlYVw?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\t\t</p>\n","title":"TripleLift’s Programmatic in a Post-Cookie World Panel ","uri":"/blog/programmatic-in-post-cookie-world-panel-video/","date":"May 14, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNjA=","name":"Chrome"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMTQ=","name":"Programmatic Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMTU=","name":"Third-Party Cookies"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/43c533c623b125bd9f35a90cefc89231/69209/05141_PostCookieVid.jpg","srcSet":"/static/43c533c623b125bd9f35a90cefc89231/e9e8b/05141_PostCookieVid.jpg 250w,\n/static/43c533c623b125bd9f35a90cefc89231/84742/05141_PostCookieVid.jpg 500w,\n/static/43c533c623b125bd9f35a90cefc89231/69209/05141_PostCookieVid.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/43c533c623b125bd9f35a90cefc89231/98dbc/05141_PostCookieVid.avif 250w,\n/static/43c533c623b125bd9f35a90cefc89231/92e1f/05141_PostCookieVid.avif 500w,\n/static/43c533c623b125bd9f35a90cefc89231/9b3e4/05141_PostCookieVid.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/43c533c623b125bd9f35a90cefc89231/0b151/05141_PostCookieVid.webp 250w,\n/static/43c533c623b125bd9f35a90cefc89231/33dd0/05141_PostCookieVid.webp 500w,\n/static/43c533c623b125bd9f35a90cefc89231/6429b/05141_PostCookieVid.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/eric-berry-finalist-entrepreneur-of-the-year-2019-new-york-awards/","title":"TripleLift Co-Founder & CEO Eric Berry Named Finalist for Entrepreneur Of The Year® 2019 New York Awards"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/branded-content-programmatic-advertising/","title":"Can Branded Content Go Programmatic?
