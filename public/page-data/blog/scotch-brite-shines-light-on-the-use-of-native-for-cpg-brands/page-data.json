According to a study by <a href=\"https://bit.ly/1uOIZpD\">@ANAmarketers</a>, 63% of marketers will increase their budgets for native advertising in 2015, findings that were consistent with <a href=\"https://bit.ly/1njL1NH\">@eMarketer</a>’s forecast that said native ad spending in 2015 would be $4.3B &#8211; a 34% increase over 2014.</p>\n<p>We’re already seeing CPG brands investing a greater share of their budgets on native advertising, and we’re seeing them be wildly successful to boot.  TripleLift worked with Scotch-Brite, one of 3M’s strongest consumer brands, to drive increased engagement and social buzz as part of their foray into native.</p>\n<p>Scotch-Brite’s campaign strategy was to position itself as the brand with the tools needed for cleaning all around the home.  They wanted to seamlessly integrate their message alongside contextually relevant content where users would be most receptive to the ads.</p>\n<p>With a product as diverse as Scotch-Brite, it was important to use images that not only embodied the brand’s values, but also captured the attention of potential customers in their native execution. TripleLift worked with the Scotch-Brite team to select powerful images that spoke for themselves and chose relevant sites where Scotch-Brite’s message would shine.</p>\n<p>Scotch-Brite’s visual content was designed to seamlessly match the unique look and feel of hundreds of sites meeting their targeted audience.  The result was beautifully integrated ads that looked unique to every site and drove increases in CTR, mouseovers, and social sharing.</p>\n<p><figure id=\"attachment_438\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-438\" style=\"width: 1190px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg\"><span class=\" wp-image-438  inline-gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%;width:1190px\" data-reactroot=\"\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"width:100%;padding-bottom:87.58389261744966%\"></span><img aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:0;transition-delay:500ms\"/><picture><source srcSet=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/0157d/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 298w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/b7e7d/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 595w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/195bb/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1190w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/54987/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1487w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px\"/><img sizes=\"(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px\" srcSet=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/0157d/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 298w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/b7e7d/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 595w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/195bb/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1190w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/54987/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1487w\" src=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/195bb/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg\" alt=\"Scotch-Brite Native Ads TripleLift\" loading=\"eager\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition:opacity 500ms\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source srcset=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/0157d/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 298w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/b7e7d/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 595w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/195bb/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1190w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/54987/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1487w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px\" /><img loading=\"eager\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px\" srcset=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/0157d/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 298w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/b7e7d/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 595w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/195bb/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1190w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/54987/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1487w\" src=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/195bb/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg\" alt=\"Scotch-Brite Native Ads TripleLift\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center\"/></picture></noscript></span></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-438\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Scotch-Brite Native Ads Powered by TripleLift&#8217;s Native Ad Platform</figcaption></figure></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">So why is native better for brand campaigns?  Well for one, it is not ignored; banner blindness is still a very big concern for the industry.  Built into the fabric of the sites it lives, consumers are more likely to engage with native ads versus a banner.  (Though they should always be labeled as ads.)  And, consumers are more likely to share these native ads.  While not a replacement for organic social media, brands can use sponsored influence to spark conversations and gain awareness as Scotch-Brite did.  It should not feel like an ad, meaning, you should not be selling, you should be speaking to the consumer’s interest that reflects the experience of the site they are visiting.    Because native ads tend to be more contextually relevant, this helps brands inject themselves into a person’s passions or hobbies on the sites they love.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">CPG’s share of digital spending on brand advertising will likely be mixture of native, social, and mobile, and not a reliance on banners.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\t\t</p>\n","title":"Scotch-Brite™ Shines Light on the Use of Native for CPG Brands","uri":"/blog/scotch-brite-shines-light-on-the-use-of-native-for-cpg-brands/","date":"March 23, 2015","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0Nw==","name":"ad tech"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0OA==","name":"ads"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0OQ==","name":"advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1MA==","name":"agencies"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2Mw==","name":"brand marketing"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo4MA==","name":"Branding"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMjg=","name":"case"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1MQ==","name":"content marketing"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMjk=","name":"CPG"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Mg==","name":"digital advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Mw==","name":"digital marketing"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1NA==","name":"Digital Media"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2NA==","name":"display advertising"},{},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2NQ==","name":"images"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo4Ng==","name":"in-feed"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMDI=","name":"insights"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1NQ==","name":"marketing"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Ng==","name":"native"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Nw==","name":"native ads"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OA==","name":"Native advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OQ==","name":"nativeadvertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo3MQ==","name":"online advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMzA=","name":"study"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo4NQ==","name":"triplelift"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo3OA==","name":"Visual Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo3OQ==","name":"visual web"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/15c9317bf53ab986ec4c73b54a948c4b/252d0/scotch1000.jpg","srcSet":"/static/15c9317bf53ab986ec4c73b54a948c4b/aa7af/scotch1000.jpg 250w,\n/static/15c9317bf53ab986ec4c73b54a948c4b/05ae3/scotch1000.jpg 500w,\n/static/15c9317bf53ab986ec4c73b54a948c4b/252d0/scotch1000.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/15c9317bf53ab986ec4c73b54a948c4b/7b8a1/scotch1000.avif 250w,\n/static/15c9317bf53ab986ec4c73b54a948c4b/ca9cd/scotch1000.avif 500w,\n/static/15c9317bf53ab986ec4c73b54a948c4b/eea65/scotch1000.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/15c9317bf53ab986ec4c73b54a948c4b/002ed/scotch1000.webp 250w,\n/static/15c9317bf53ab986ec4c73b54a948c4b/d87a7/scotch1000.webp 500w,\n/static/15c9317bf53ab986ec4c73b54a948c4b/fdc78/scotch1000.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":565}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)};
