At <a href=\"https://www.ces.tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>CES 2019</strong></a>, 5G, Augmented Reality, Autonomous Vehicles, Artificial Intelligence and IoT took center stage, signaling a drastic shift that will take place in consumers’ daily lives. But they also signal a reminder of what’s always been important — the consumer experience. Using technology to create new experiences was at the forefront for brands and publishers at CES.&nbsp; Here are some of the biggest trends from the show.</p>\n<h4>Blurring the Lines Between Print and Digital</h4>\n<p>Virtual reality was a big hit at the show with interactive demonstrations, but augmented reality is where brands are concentrating most, due to its projected growth and mass market potential. At CES, Meredith Corp announced Smart Codes — a part of their new <a href=\"https://meredith.mediaroom.com/2019-01-07-Meredith-Corporation-To-Launch-Meredith-Innovation-Group-Meredith-Product-Studio-Meredith-Voice-Network-And-Meredith-Smart-Codes-At-The-Consumer-Electronics-Show\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Innovation Group</a> offerings. This format allows a consumer to scan print pages with their smartphone and access many types of digital experiences. Meredith first tested this technology on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 2017, using the publication’s own content to bring a climb up Mount Everest (in 360<b>°</b> video) right into their audience’s palms. This blurring of lines between print and digital brings a whole new element to the idea of content consumption and interactive media.</p>\n<h4>Revolutionizing the Way We Ride</h4>\n<p>While the concept of the autonomous vehicles has been around for many years, the inside of the car is becoming increasingly important. Honda debuted a prototype of their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A_3qtW06Io&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dream Drive</a> infotainment system, which goes beyond streaming music and GPS by adding an in-car purchase feature. Drivers and passengers can purchase things such as food and gas without having to open their wallets. The Dream Drive also has a rewards system allowing consumers to acquire points by simply sitting in their car — reward points that can be traded in for gift cards for major retailers and restaurants like Amazon, GameStop and Dunkin. &nbsp;This infotainment system represents a new world of possibilities for revolutionizing the consumer experience in both transportation and content consumption.</p>\n<h4>Deeper Conversations with Your TV</h4>\n<p>We can’t discuss CES without bringing up voice technology. Voice capabilities have expanded exponentially over the last five years. While there’s an increase in partnerships between automotive and smart home brands, it’s TV implementations that will truly change consumers’ home behavior. LG announced that their 2019 TVs will <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/samsungs-2019-tvs-will-work-with-amazon-alexa-and-google-assistant-ces-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">incorporate both</a> Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. This will allow a user to treat their TV like a large smart speaker and remote control —&nbsp;all in a single screen, creating an experience that’s both visual and audible. This voice technology will also enable consumers to run visually enhanced skills, such as pulling up recipes or videos. While voice has been expanding, it has up to this point been used primarily for routine tasks, such as checking the weather or streaming music — leaving many brands unsure of the use cases for this technology. The incorporation of voice into TV opens up engagement opportunities for consumers, expanding the potential for brands to connect with their audience through a more dynamic medium.</p>\n<p>As a whole, new technologies are creating limitless opportunities for brands to engage with their consumers. Bob Bakish, CEO of Viacom, summed up the concept perfectly at the CES Entertainment Summit, “If you’re of the mindset ‘We have to only stay here,’ then you’ll never grow your business.” We must understand these new platforms and how they play into brands’ marketing strategies in order to deliver a better consumer experience — a fact that will drive better business impact. Now is the best time to look beyond metrics and focus on using technology to create true engagement and relationships with audiences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","title":"CES 2019: How Brands Are Using Technology to Enhance the Consumer Experience","uri":"/blog/ces-2019-brand-technology-enhance-consumer-experience/","date":"January 16, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMDA=","name":"CES 2019"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMDE=","name":"Consumer Electronics Show"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMDI=","name":"Consumer Experience"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":null,"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/triplelift-introduces-native-awards-best-native-ads-2018/","title":"TripleLift Introduces The First Native Awards: Celebrating the Best Ads of 2018"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/triplelift-names-leading-product-executive-andrew-eifler-svp/","title":"TripleLift Names Leading Product Executive  Andrew Eifler as SVP"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozODM3","previousPostId":"cG9zdDozODQ5","nextPostId":"cG9zdDozODI1"}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
