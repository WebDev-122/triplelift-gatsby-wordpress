We announced that we would be donating to World Central Kitchen to deliver warm meals for each meeting we held in the month of April. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Within weeks of launching “Every Meeting Makes a Difference,” we received an enormous amount of support from our industry colleagues through virtual meetings, events and social engagement. We’re proud to say that we have doubled our original pledge and <strong>donated 5,800 meals</strong> to World Central Kitchen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>World Central Kitchen has served more than 3 million meals to vulnerable communities and frontline healthcare workers in over 155 cities in more than 25 states and territories. By going about our normal work day, together with our clients and partners we were able to make a difference for our healthcare heroes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are grateful for every person who supported us this month for “Every Meeting Makes a Difference” and thrilled to announce that we are extending this initiative through the month of May.</p>\n<p><span class=\"aligncenter wp-image-25125 size-full inline-gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%;width:1200px\" data-reactroot=\"\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"width:100%;padding-bottom:52.333333333333336%\"></span><img aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,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\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:0;transition-delay:500ms\"/><picture><source srcSet=\"/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/f2d49/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png 300w,\n/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/ff59c/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png 600w,\n/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/5ece7/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"/><img sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcSet=\"/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/f2d49/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png 300w,\n/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/ff59c/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png 600w,\n/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/5ece7/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png 1200w\" src=\"/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/5ece7/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png\" alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition:opacity 500ms\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source srcset=\"/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/f2d49/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png 300w,\n/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/ff59c/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png 600w,\n/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/5ece7/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><img loading=\"eager\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/f2d49/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png 300w,\n/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/ff59c/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png 600w,\n/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/5ece7/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png 1200w\" src=\"/static/83c35718edd9a13233be499d978302a5/5ece7/TL_MealRoll_5800-SocialAssets-SecretSize.png\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center\"/></picture></noscript></span><br />________</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Original post dated: April 8, 2020</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Coronavirus is taking its toll on everyone. Companies are challenged, industries are reeling, and large swaths of the world are sheltering-in-place. Yet, there are heroes emerging among us &#8212; the healthcare professionals who are facing incredibly dangerous challenges. They are working tirelessly to save lives while putting their own health and safety on the line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the advertising industry, we are&#8230;working from home. Each day, we’re creating and recreating marketing plans that address the fast moving nature of this moment in history. We are each surely rising to our own occasion. But, it is still so hard to reconcile the work we’re doing &#8211; taking place through the relative safety of Zoom and Slack &#8211; with the life saving efforts playing out in hospitals around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most of us don’t have the training to tend to the sick, we do have the ability to help the heroes. TripleLift is supporting <a href=\"https://wck.org/chefsforamerica\">World Central Kitchen</a>, the organization delivering fresh, hot meals to medical professionals and relief workers. <strong>Every virtual meeting we hold during the month of April will unlock 3 meals to feed heroes working on the frontlines.</strong> We are committed to donating up to $10,000 during the month.</p>\n\n<p>If it makes sense to <a href=\"/contact-us/?utm_source=int&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=meals&amp;utm_content=lp\">join us for a meeting</a> to help address your digital media plans, let’s hop on a video chat.  And then, just by going about our jobs, we will together make it easier for so many others to go about theirs.</p>\n<p>Every meeting makes a difference.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:

takes 21 days to form a habit.”  To put that into perspective, most of us have been quarantining for far longer than that.  In that time, we have been working differently, socializing differently and spending our money differently.  Even if many of our activities go back to normal in the months ahead, a whole lot of change is underway.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On this 50th day of my own shelter-in-place – more than double the amount of time that it supposedly takes to form a habit – I marked the occasion by writing down some predictions for how the world might change when we ultimately emerge from the most serious aspects of this pandemic. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an advertising community, it’s critical for all of us to study the implications in order to help our brands survive and thrive through this downturn.</span></p>\n<p><b>Rise of self-serve.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <br />We will see increased investment in automation that replaces human workers in favor of self-serve systems – think: more self-checkouts at retailers. Much of the technology will be accessible through our own mobile devices, not just in-store kiosks. The bet will be made that doing business this way is cheaper in the long-term and more hygienic in the short-term. For marketers, there will be more opportunities to use the interfaces of those systems, as well as the data they throw off, to target our messaging.<br /><br /></span></span></span></span><b>Going cashless.</b> <br />Debit and credit cards are already a big part of life – only about 30% of purchases in the U.S. pre-pandemic were made with cash. But there’s still so much room to go. Post-Corona, people won’t want to touch money and it will be easier to go cashless with the proliferation of self-service technologies. Credit card and payment system companies stand to benefit more quickly than they might have previously planned. Still: marketing to consumers in this space is about to get a lot more cluttered.</p>\n<p><b>Decline of traditional broadcast.</b> <br />Here’s what we know: streaming is fast becoming a habit, cord cutting is spiking, content production has largely shutdown, the fall tv season will be delayed and consumers are subscribing to an increasing number of OTT services. Digital video (a category that includes streaming services) accounted for 8% of all “time spent with media” just 5 years ago. That figure has been growing by a point each year and eMarketer had projected it to hit 14% in 2020. But, due to the habits formed during this quarantine, the shift from linear to streaming will accelerate even faster than the most bullish projections. By the end of this year, we might actually hit the metric predicted for 2022. Marketers had already been shifting their video mix but, when dollars come back, we should see an even greater shift to digital video: in-stream, out-stream and especially OTT.</p>\n<p><b>The ascendency of eSports.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <br />This trend has been coming for years (is it “the year of gaming” yet?), but ad spend hasn’t caught up with usage. It’s entirely possible that the NBA and NHL cancel the remainder of their seasons and that Major League Baseball doesn’t see a single pitch this year. As time spent playing online continues to grow, media &amp; sponsorship dollars will ultimately flow. It might not happen immediately, but we will see it take off with the next economic recovery.<br /></span></span></span></p>\n<p><b>Subsidized WiFi infrastructure.</b> <br />Living and working in areas of the country with poor connectivity is suboptimal for the affected communities – quarantine or no quarantine. Much has been written about the challenge of school kids not being able to properly e-learn due to low bandwidth. By the transitive powers, that means many businesses have also been at a deficit. Moving forward, governments (perhaps the states, since our federal government can’t seem to rally) will fund improvements, enabling their citizens to better compete. That means: more online services and accelerated opportunities for brands and media companies in rural areas.</p>\n<p><b>Essential Cloud.</b> <br />The Cloud has become the underlying technology of this generation. What the phone companies were to the 20th century, the Cloud companies are to the 21st.  Infrastructure from Amazon, Microsoft, Google and IBM, along with applications like Zoom, Slack, Instacart and Venmo are the way we operate now. We will look at this period of time as the moment when Cloud went from smart business to essential living.</p>\n<p><b>Reduced influence of cities – Part 1.</b> <br />They’re expensive, they’re congested and they’re petri dishes for disease (relatively speaking). With technology becoming optimized for rural areas, more people will be able to balance their careers and their preferred lifestyle. It’s not just suburbs that could swell, all of those towns in the special issues of <i>Outside Magazine</i> (“Anytown, Colorado” and “This Place, New Mexico”) will become destinations for migration. Employers will follow&#8230;and so will brands.</p>\n<p><b>Reduced influence of cities – Part 2.</b> <br />They aren’t just expensive for citizens – they’re also incredibly expensive for businesses. White collar companies have only made the math work by packing workers into open seating and expanding additional operations to more cost-efficient, secondary locations. Local businesses like restaurants have had to shutter due to reliance on razor-thin cashflow. And, if you live in New York, you know that retail vacancies were already a problem in every neighborhood.  Cities are in for a long reset.</p>\n<p><b>Commercial real-estate correction.</b> <br />The average price of commercial real-estate in London recently was $88/square foot. New York: $83. Boston: $65. Between this (hopefully short-term) economic downturn, the long-term correction coming to cities, and the likes of WeWork and Knotel offering month-to-month solutions, the overall commercial market will see immense downward pressure. Companies will exercise out-clauses, seek smaller spaces and use their leverage to negotiate better deals.</p>\n<p><b>Remote working.</b> <br />We will go back to the office. But, even companies with previously strict work from home policies will relax their rules. At first, some will be more accommodating because of the ongoing fears of their employees. Over time, it will become a more accepted standard practice since we now have a better gauge on how to evaluate good remote work performance…and bad. The implications are many, including the continued reinforcement of many of the projections above.</p>\n<p><b>Copying the Amazon Model.</b> <br />Beyond the core businesses of .com and AWS, think about the even bigger juggernaut Amazon has created. All of these divisions &#8211; many of them built via acquisition &#8211; are perfect fits for the new normal: Audible, Twitch, IMDB, Ring, Alexa, Fresh, Prime, Prime Air and The Washington Post. Each one is built for the Cloud and each complements most of the others. We will see even more corporate investment shift toward cloud-based businesses, looking to the Amazon model as the gold standard.</p>\n<p><b>New data-first industries.</b> <br />With more-and-more data exhaust being created by all of our cloud-based activities, new start-ups will form to utilize that data (hopefully non-PII). Their aim: helping clients acquire new customers and service current ones &#8212; CRM on steroids. Governments will lag in regulating this data giving industries a head start to build out their categories.</p>\n<p><b>New entry level work.</b> <br />As we see fewer cashier jobs (and bank tellers, and stock clerks), we will see a rise in logistics jobs – from coding to analytics to warehousing. All of these roles will be critical as we shift from in-person to remote demand. As we try to make our way back from double-digit unemployment, these burgeoning job categories will aid our recovery.</p>\n<p><b>Big shakeout in DTC.</b> <br />Yes, there’s bloat across categories and not all would have survived anyway. But can 50 companies selling $300 watches and 100 companies selling $150 sweatpants really survive in an economic downturn? (Answer: they cannot.) Direct-to-consumer won’t go away, but we will see many of the current ones fold and new categories sprout from the ashes.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All-in: there will be lots of change. But, with big change comes big opportunity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Billions of dollars are up for grabs in the shifts that are about to take place. Brands that throw out old assumptions and take chances, will adapt, survive and thrive. It’s going to be a rocky road, but it will be a prosperous one for those that keep their ear to ground.</span></p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n","title":"14 Ways Our World Will Change After Coronavirus","uri":"/blog/ways-our-world-will-change-after-coronavirus/","date":"May 01, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/254b7142a63cce4147672c310e803a25/8f3c3/covid-blog.png","srcSet":"/static/254b7142a63cce4147672c310e803a25/5add7/covid-blog.png 250w,\n/static/254b7142a63cce4147672c310e803a25/aef42/covid-blog.png 500w,\n/static/254b7142a63cce4147672c310e803a25/8f3c3/covid-blog.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/254b7142a63cce4147672c310e803a25/98dbc/covid-blog.avif 250w,\n/static/254b7142a63cce4147672c310e803a25/92e1f/covid-blog.avif 500w,\n/static/254b7142a63cce4147672c310e803a25/9b3e4/covid-blog.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/254b7142a63cce4147672c310e803a25/0b151/covid-blog.webp 250w,\n/static/254b7142a63cce4147672c310e803a25/33dd0/covid-blog.webp 500w,\n/static/254b7142a63cce4147672c310e803a25/6429b/covid-blog.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNTA4NA==","excerpt":"<p>Authored by: Chelsea Murray, Account Director, Platform Partnerships, TripleLift Marketers now have direct access to TripleLift Native, Video and Display supply in Display &amp; Video 360.

We are in the midst of a global health scare the likes of which nobody currently alive has ever experienced. There simply aren’t any parallels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do know this, however: there are people and industries that are critical to our ability to navigate this crisis. Doctors, nurses and hospital workers are helping us care for the sick. Farmers, warehouse workers and grocery clerks are ensuring the proper functioning of our food supply.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, perhaps one of the most critical jobs right now &#8211; important and oftentimes dangerous work to help us survive and thrive through this pandemic &#8211; is being done by journalists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>News gathering organizations are reporting from the frontlines, wading through an endless and fast moving ocean of information &#8212; all in the interest of keeping us informed. In times like these, journalism has never been more important for the proper functioning of society. Who else will separate fact from fiction, speak truth to power and provide important context to arm us with the insights needed to make decisions that keep ourselves and our families safe?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still: news publishers are facing a ‘crisis within the crisis.’ Consumer demand for the news has never been higher, but advertiser demand for those impressions has fallen off precipitously. Traffic to news sites is up 57% since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak, but CPMs are down 20% in that same timeframe. In a world of supply and demand, this shouldn’t make sense. But, there’s a straight-forward answer as to why this is happening and a simple solution to address it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monetization has fallen due in large part to the decision by some very large brands to steer clear of the news category entirely. Many of those advertisers simply do not want the message association, so they are blacklisting Covid-19 content or the news category entirely. There are a number of <a href=\"https://www.newsworks.org.uk/resources/hard-news-project\">studies</a> that show brands actually get a lift from running ads adjacent to news, but it has become conventional wisdom &#8211; false as it may be &#8211; that news content is undesirable content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this pandemic is an unpleasant story, without the support of brands, news won’t be able to properly function through this period and will be forever changed moving forward. Choking off this category isn’t helping anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your Advertising Dollars Can Do Double Duty</strong><br>Investing in quality news content at a time when it’s being consumed at peak levels not only makes business sense &#8211; driving reach and achieving ROI at reasonable CPMs &#8211; but it also funds an important pillar of society. Your brand can be associated with that support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put simply: brands have the opportunity to reach their objectives while playing a role in the survival of journalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>#HelpJournalism</strong><br>TripleLift has created a curated package of impressions to help brands position themselves thoughtfully within the world’s most respected news content. Attributes of this package include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Focus on Premium News Publishers.</strong> Run exclusively on publishers that deliver properly gathered and edited news to society. Publishers including: The New York Times, BBC, USA Today, Chicago Tribune, CNN, Vox and San Francisco Chronicle.</li><li><strong>100% Direct Inventory. </strong>All of the inventory comes directly from publishers. Zero impressions are resold &#8212; all publisher spend goes to the publishers.</li><li><strong>KPIs Delivered&#8230;In Your Required Timeframe. </strong>Packages designed to meet ROI expectation and easily activated on a single deal ID.</li><li><strong>Low CPMs.&nbsp; </strong>Take advantage of all-time low CPMs for premium news content.</li><li><strong>Positive Association</strong>. Society needs the news category needs right now, and the news category needs advertisers. By participating in #HelpJournalism, brands and agencies will be making positive change by simply spending their ad dollars wisely. After all, this could be a good news story in more ways than one.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Update June 4, 2020</em><br>GroupM is the first holding company to <a href=\"https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/triplelifts-help-journalism-program-incents-brands-to-advertise-against-hard-news/#more-135579\">join the effort</a>, and has signed more than a dozen of its clients to the program, focusing on 600 multicultural and local news sites. “This topic is of great importance to us,” John Montgomery, executive vice president of global brand safety at GroupM told <a href=\"https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/352081/triplelift-launches-help-journalism-programmatic.html\">MediaPost</a>, “Journalism is essential to the proper functioning of society, especially at a time when there is a great threat to the health and financial wellbeing of almost everyone on Earth. Imagine, not having essential news reporting during the Great Depression or on 9/11.

It has shaken our world in a way with no precedent. We may have loved ones, friends, or friends of friends that have succumbed to the disease. This is truly a global tragedy. Yet the reach of this extends beyond those directly battling or potentially exposed to the virus. It has attacked the core of our society &#8211; including our social nature and the global system of trade. We have all been forcefully thrust into this new world and it is truly painful. It is painful because of its direct health consequences. It is painful because it has lowered our quality of life. And it is painful because the economic collapse has forced companies like TripleLift to respond with measures like those we took this week.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This difficult time has yielded difficult choices. Employee and compensation reductions are hard pills to swallow. Everyone at TripleLift is affected, though some more acutely than others. The company&#8217;s intentions with the actions we have taken are three-fold: ensure our ability to navigate these turbulent waters on our own terms, create reversible decisions that are actionable as the economy recovers, and treat every one of us with respect and humanity.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As challenging as this has been, these decisions will have positive effects for the company moving forward.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Expenses</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>.</strong> Our expenses are now controlled such that we can break-even at a significantly lower revenue total than our original plan over the remainder of the year. The likelihood of negative outcomes for all industries has significantly increased, but our revised operating plan immediately places our company in a strong position to withstand the crisis. To go along with our new expense plan, we have eight-figures of cash in the bank, built up over four years of accelerating profitability.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Products</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>.</strong> Our product roadmap is still completely in-tact, with a suite of ad products that are right for the times: native, display, content and video. Additionally, we made the decision to continue the growing investment in our OTT products – a category that will see even larger demand as society emerges from its quarantine.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Service</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>.</strong> We have lost a number of well-regarded colleagues and we feel deeply that they are no longer with us. But, in every choice we made, we considered our customers and partners. Through careful and precise planning, we have ensured absolutely no adverse impact in our ability to deliver services, nor any disruption in the uptime of our platform.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being disciplined is the principle that has guided our tremendous growth to-date and being disciplined will allow us to emerge from this time in a relatively strong position. Advertising budgets will eventually return to their normal levels. And we will be better positioned strategically, competitively, and financially to succeed than we were going into the pandemic because we were prepared to look like we overreacted, and because we understand that being prepared to look like you overreacted is essential to surviving a moment like this one.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I said at the conclusion of our All-Hands meeting: I am confident in a number of things today.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I am confident that today is a bad day for everyone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But, I am also confident that:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have taken the necessary actions to balance our books</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have not sacrificed our long-term prospects – if anything, we have enhanced that position</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have the right product strategy to meet these times</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have built partnerships to help us flourish through good times and bad</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have a great team moving forward</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And…our best days – despite the current challenges – are still ahead of us</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eric</span></p>\n","title":"Discipline in Uncertain Times","uri":"/blog/discipline-uncertain-times/","date":"April 02, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0OQ==","name":"advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"Our Operational Plan: The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/8f3c3/TL_pattern-shapes.png","srcSet":"/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/5add7/TL_pattern-shapes.png 250w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/aef42/TL_pattern-shapes.png 500w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/8f3c3/TL_pattern-shapes.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/98dbc/TL_pattern-shapes.avif 250w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/92e1f/TL_pattern-shapes.avif 500w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/9b3e4/TL_pattern-shapes.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/0b151/TL_pattern-shapes.webp 250w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/33dd0/TL_pattern-shapes.webp 500w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/6429b/TL_pattern-shapes.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNDU3NA==","excerpt":"<p>This interview was originally between markenartikel, a prominent German publication, and TripleLift General Counsel and Chief Privacy Officer, Julia Shullman.

What problems will advertisers face with this change? What do the restrictions mean for businesses?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Julia Shullman: </strong> It is a fundamental break that will make it difficult to maintain the status quo. Advertisers face two challenges if they continue with business as usual. First, they will need to ensure they have an alternative browser ID to use to deploy their own data, so they can measure the delivery and effectiveness of their ads across different digital properties through various ad tech vendors and platforms. Second, they’ll have to find a way to maintain the use of the ad tech vendors of their choice to do this. Publishers, and their ad tech vendors, face similar challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For us, the announcement by Google actually represents a great opportunity for advertisers,  but also for the industry at large. The advertising ecosystem has become misunderstood by consumers and the parties within the ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The foreseeable end of third-party cookies is an excellent forcing function (coming on the heels of Safari and Mozilla). Our industry is at the start of the next cycle in ad tech and has the opportunity to rethink advertising. We can focus on providing a more transparent and efficient experience by rethinking how user data is collected, used and shared, and providing ads that are informative, respectful and, non-intrusive and fit within the flow of publishers’ environment.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift is well positioned as a vendor focused on maintaining direct relationships with publishers and providing advertisers a direct path to supply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>markenartikel:</strong> GDPR has already been applied in Europe. For marketing, this means that third-party data can only be used with the permission of the user. How has this worked in practice so far? Have these conditions proved to be an opportunity for better quality?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shullman:</strong> The interplay between the online consumer experience, transparency and user choice requirements in GDPR, and the existing ePrivacy Directive, is challenging. However, does that require a complete interruption of a user’s online journey with consent banners blocking access to content or forcing a user to login?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Germany, in particular, there’s a debate about whether a publisher and its ad tech vendors require consent to use cookies or to use other identifiers associated with browsers and devices that consumers use which deliver and measure ads. Many believe if a publisher provides transparency and choice to their users and restricts their ad tech vendors’ use of their users’ data, the user experience shouldn’t be ruined. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see publishers and advertisers using privacy regulations to push for better control and transparency in their supply chains and for better consumer transparency and choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>markenartikel: </strong>What is the alternative for third-party cookies? Is there a market solution, an ID?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shullman: </strong>If industry is looking to replace browser identifiers and potentially other device-related advertising with another identifier, a variety of proprietary and industry alternatives and coalitions exist. However, at least today, none of these solutions come close to having the breadth of data and infrastructure of large consumer-facing platforms like Google. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to talk about identity and understand why it is not working in the transfigural sense and how it should be managed and controlled in the future across the entire ecosystem. We need to do this from both a consumer and commercial perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We support industry-led solutions or simple interoperable proprietary solutions designed to try to fix the ecosystem in order to make it work better — including creation of an alternative solution for browsers and other device identifiers, whether used at a user or cohort level. Ideally these solutions are incubated and managed by an existing industry association like the IAB, which we believe is well-placed given its relationship with IAB TechLab.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry factions should not quarrel across different constituents or across different markets.  That will  end with no viable industry solution, leaving the large platforms designing and deploying the ultimate solution, not because it’s best but because the industry couldn’t get its act together to align on the right solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>markenartikel:</strong> What role could data alliances play?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shullman: </strong>There is certainly a role for data alliances — whether related to online identifiers or related to data deployed using those identifiers. Those data alliances, however, will only work if their solutions are aligned with the solutions of the ad tech vendors they rely on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>markenartikel: </strong>Which data will determine the success of campaigns in the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shullman:</strong> Data that’s been appropriately collected and over which the user has appropriate permissions and controls. The parties looking to deploy that data must have an appropriate mechanism to deploy and use it in a transparent and privacy protective manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>markenartikel:</strong> To what extent has GDPR and e-privacy brought the topic of data ownership into the focus of companies? What are the advantages of first-party data, and how can companies proceed to generate this data in a data protection-compliant and secure manner?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shullman:</strong>  I’m not sure GDPR and e-privacy have focused on data ownership. Instead, they’ve focused on a consumer’s right to transparency and control over who can collect their data and how it is used.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those requirements benefit companies with direct consumer relationships like large platforms with consumer-facing products or devices that don’t have to share data with other parties.  They also benefit publishers and their vendors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically the requirements don’t really benefit advertisers because it isn’t well known to consumers that their data may be collected by a brand in one circumstance (e.g. when a consumer buys a good or product from that brand) and then the brand uses that data later to target the user on a publisher’s digital property where the brand’s ad is being shown.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, between publishers and advertisers, the requirements favor publishers who can more easily explain to consumers that data collected by them on their digital properties is being used to tailor ads on those same digital properties and protect that data from being shared too broadly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>markenartikel: </strong>Which advertisers benefit from third-party data? Are they still important for the acquisition of new customers as well as cross or upselling? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shullman: </strong>Advertisers do need to rely on the data of others (e.g. publishers and other technology providers) when looking to draw in new consumers. Privacy regulations certainly make this more challenging and benefits consumer-facing platforms and companies that can allow advertisers to benefit from their services and vendors using this data without actually sharing the data with them.</p>\n","title":"The Advertising Industry Is at the Beginning of Its Next Cycle","uri":"/blog/the-advertising-industry-is-at-the-beginning-of-its-next-cycle/","date":"March 24, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0MDY=","name":"Chief Privacy Officer"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0MDE=","name":"Cookie-Less World"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTozOTU=","name":"Germany"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTozOTc=","name":"Press"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0MDc=","name":"press coverage"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNzY=","name":"privacy"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMTU=","name":"Third-Party Cookies"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8aa2c05272f14266eee48ca02f9274e0/69209/Bye_Cookies.jpg","srcSet":"/static/8aa2c05272f14266eee48ca02f9274e0/e9e8b/Bye_Cookies.jpg 250w,\n/static/8aa2c05272f14266eee48ca02f9274e0/84742/Bye_Cookies.jpg 500w,\n/static/8aa2c05272f14266eee48ca02f9274e0/69209/Bye_Cookies.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/8aa2c05272f14266eee48ca02f9274e0/98dbc/Bye_Cookies.avif 250w,\n/static/8aa2c05272f14266eee48ca02f9274e0/92e1f/Bye_Cookies.avif 500w,\n/static/8aa2c05272f14266eee48ca02f9274e0/9b3e4/Bye_Cookies.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/8aa2c05272f14266eee48ca02f9274e0/0b151/Bye_Cookies.webp 250w,\n/static/8aa2c05272f14266eee48ca02f9274e0/33dd0/Bye_Cookies.webp 500w,\n/static/8aa2c05272f14266eee48ca02f9274e0/6429b/Bye_Cookies.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNDU2MQ==","excerpt":"<p>By Eric Berry, TripleLift CEO &amp; Co-Founder These are challenging times: for the world and our industry.

While not through face-to-face meetings, we are well armed with our laptops, e-mail, Zoom, Slack and Trello. Through the cloud, we forge on with our mission to help make advertising better for everyone.</p>\n<h5><b>Executional Plans</b></h5>\n<p>We are open for business for all of our customers: publishers, brands and agencies. You can contact us via all the same channels you always have — whether it’s to support the business we already do together or to inspire new pathways to drive results. We have been building packages to help steer your business through these times and will continue to roll them out in the days and weeks ahead.</p>\n<h5><b>Strategic Plans</b></h5>\n<p>We intend to release our new display and video products as promised in Q2. These products have been created with their inventory directness in mind — the kind of placements that are even more effective when results are a necessity. They were conceived months ago, but are perfect for the times we live in today.</p>\n<p>We are also pushing forward with our plans to bring initial product tests to market later this year in support of our forthcoming OTT portfolio. While the global economy is reeling, we know that now, and in the future, media solutions must continue to evolve to meet customer demand.

Whether the virus sparks a complete downturn or temporary correction is unclear, but due to the inextricable link between consumer spending and advertising, the media community’s shared anxiety is growing daily.</p>\n<p>However, there’s reason for the programmatic advertising sector to anticipate stability. Programmatically transactable digital media – and the companies that power it ­– has a few defining characteristics that suggest it would fare better in challenging times. Advertisers should take note.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, during times of instability, we can expect a flight to accountability, agility and continuity.</p>\n<p><b>Accountability</b></p>\n<p>While programmatic occupies a larger section of the marketing funnel, it is still primarily a highly targeted, mid- to lower-funnel protocol frequently used for direct response campaigns that align with last-touch attribution. This manner relies less on the speculative nature of branding and more on the data-driven, outcome-based formula that feeds programmatic algorithms industrywide.</p>\n<p>When results can be so cleanly tied to spend, that spend should continue to be justifiable, even in a downturn.</p>\n<p>And as brands look for cost-savings, one of the first places they look is their agencies. One more forward-thinking move is for brands to invest in and take more control of their programmatic strategy and budgets to save costs and invest in a more efficient form of media. This could have ripple effects downstream that also benefit the programmatic entities that power those transactions.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.adexchanger.com/data-driven-thinking/in-the-face-of-an-economic-downturn-programmatic-may-be-well-positioned/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Continue reading the full article on AdExchanger here</a>.&nbsp; </strong></p>\n","title":"In the Face of an Economic Downturn, Programmatic May Be Well Positioned","uri":"/blog/programmatic-stability-economic-downturn/","date":"March 17, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0OQ==","name":"advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo3Mg==","name":"programmatic"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"In the Face of An Economic Downturn, Programmatic May Be Well-Positioned","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/1ec4e/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.png","srcSet":"/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/5add7/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.png 250w,\n/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/aef42/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.png 500w,\n/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/1ec4e/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/98dbc/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.avif 250w,\n/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/92e1f/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.avif 500w,\n/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/1b94f/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/0b151/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.webp 250w,\n/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/33dd0/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.webp 500w,\n/static/051ed2c4458fc4c9f0961197dad812ae/589ec/programmatic-growth-blog-01-01.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":998.9999999999999}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"offset":45,"postsPerPage":9,"nextPagePath":"/blog/7","previousPagePath":"/blog/5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
