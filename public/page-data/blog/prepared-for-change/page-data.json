Like everyone, TripleLift is monitoring all the bends and turns in the road.</p>\n<p>We have been receiving emails from customers seeking clarification for our operational plans. The short answer is consistent with one of our cherished company values: we continue to “crush it daily.” Throughout this time, we have maintained all of our operations. While not through face-to-face meetings, we are well armed with our laptops, e-mail, Zoom, Slack and Trello. Through the cloud, we forge on with our mission to help make advertising better for everyone.</p>\n<h5><b>Executional Plans</b></h5>\n<p>We are open for business for all of our customers: publishers, brands and agencies. You can contact us via all the same channels you always have — whether it’s to support the business we already do together or to inspire new pathways to drive results. We have been building packages to help steer your business through these times and will continue to roll them out in the days and weeks ahead.</p>\n<h5><b>Strategic Plans</b></h5>\n<p>We intend to release our new display and video products as promised in Q2. These products have been created with their inventory directness in mind — the kind of placements that are even more effective when results are a necessity. They were conceived months ago, but are perfect for the times we live in today.</p>\n<p>We are also pushing forward with our plans to bring initial product tests to market later this year in support of our forthcoming OTT portfolio. While the global economy is reeling, we know that now, and in the future, media solutions must continue to evolve to meet customer demand. Here, too, we are proceeding full steam ahead.</p>\n<p>For as long as these challenging times last, we will be here. We take pride in being a go-to ad tech company: a long-term planner, fast-turn executor and a future bellwether. Deep inside our DNA is a need to reinvent ad placement one medium at a time.  So, for us, the more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>\n<p>We all may have to practice social distancing, but let’s keep our businesses close.</p>\n<p>Drop us a line today and let us know how we can help you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","title":"Our Operational Plan: The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same","uri":"/blog/prepared-for-change/","date":"March 23, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0OQ==","name":"advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"Our Operational Plan: The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/8f3c3/TL_pattern-shapes.png","srcSet":"/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/5add7/TL_pattern-shapes.png 250w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/aef42/TL_pattern-shapes.png 500w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/8f3c3/TL_pattern-shapes.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/98dbc/TL_pattern-shapes.avif 250w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/92e1f/TL_pattern-shapes.avif 500w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/9b3e4/TL_pattern-shapes.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/0b151/TL_pattern-shapes.webp 250w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/33dd0/TL_pattern-shapes.webp 500w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/6429b/TL_pattern-shapes.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/the-advertising-industry-is-at-the-beginning-of-its-next-cycle/","title":"The Advertising Industry Is at the Beginning of Its Next Cycle"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/programmatic-stability-economic-downturn/","title":"In the Face of an Economic Downturn, Programmatic May Be Well Positioned"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNDU2MQ==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDU3NA==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDUwMg=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
