What happens during a time of disruption? How can brands unlock consumer attention without coming across as tone-deaf or insensitive?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">TripleLift explored how to effectively approach digital storytelling amidst today’s challenges and limitations with</span><b> Erin Vogel, SVP, Content Lead, Central Region at Spark Foundry, and Dan Richardson, Senior Partner, Managing Director, Invention+ at Mindshare. </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our GM of Branded Content, Jason Kleinman, moderated the conversation.</span></p>\n<p><b>Authenticity is key.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Authenticity can be framed around a simple question: Does your brand support Gay Pride and your employees beyond creating a rainbow logo in June? Mattel launched “Play Room” and made downloads and printables available in reaction to insights that play is still important. Audible made books of various education levels available in different languages, immediately.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Recognize and support your users.<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">Who helps sell your products? Miller Lite made a donation and set up a virtual tip jar to support millions of bar and service staff out of work.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Recessions tend to drive innovation.<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-size: inherit;\">Brands are getting scrappy to develop platforms. With production limitations, some are reusing assets and tapping users and creators to develop an authentic story. Chefs are creating demos in their home kitchens with brands’ products.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Will consumers’ changed behaviors become ingrained?<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People are now used to getting things delivered and cooking at home. What will life look like when we come out on the other side? Initially pantry </span><i style=\"font-size: inherit;\">stocking</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was a big focus of consumer behavior. Can brands provide value with recipes so that these products are </span><i style=\"font-size: inherit;\">used</i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in meals.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Navigating Corporate Social Responsibility.<br />\n</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As brands wade into the good will space, how do they break through? It’s worth considering what their customers are struggling with. How are they treating their employees?&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are they doing for society?</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Reliable advice and context &#8211;</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Balance providing valuable information vs injecting a polarized or political position. Coke used their platform to show that they trust science without associating themselves with a political side.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Know your audience</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; How do they feel about a specific set of events? Nike weighed this, and the fight that might follow, when they created their campaign with Colin Kaepernick.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>What kind of value and entertainment can you offer?</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\nSupport creators and users of your products by having chefs host cooking demonstrations in their home kitchens.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>Watch the full video now.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Lift Talk: The Value of Digital Storytelling During a Time of Disruption\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/410391014?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963\" width=\"500\" height=\"256\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe><br />\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With nearly 150 participants across brands, agencies, publishers, and technology partners &#8211; we are especially thrilled to share that </span><b>we continued our company-wide initiative, <a href=\"/blog/every-meeting-makes-a-difference/?utm_source=int&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=meals&amp;utm_content=blg\">Every Meeting Makes a Difference </a></b><b>, by donating to World Central Kitchen to fund warm and fresh meals for COVID-19 frontline workers.</b></p>\n","title":"The Value of Digital Storytelling During A Time of Disruption ","uri":"/blog/value-digital-storytelling/","date":"April 23, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTo0MTA=","name":"Events"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1ff1703a7cf62105ae1174ad3aeff1ce/d1b78/TL_LiftTalks_Storytelling_Blog_1500x1500_SE2.png","srcSet":"/static/1ff1703a7cf62105ae1174ad3aeff1ce/5add7/TL_LiftTalks_Storytelling_Blog_1500x1500_SE2.png 250w,\n/static/1ff1703a7cf62105ae1174ad3aeff1ce/aef42/TL_LiftTalks_Storytelling_Blog_1500x1500_SE2.png 500w,\n/static/1ff1703a7cf62105ae1174ad3aeff1ce/d1b78/TL_LiftTalks_Storytelling_Blog_1500x1500_SE2.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1ff1703a7cf62105ae1174ad3aeff1ce/98dbc/TL_LiftTalks_Storytelling_Blog_1500x1500_SE2.avif 250w,\n/static/1ff1703a7cf62105ae1174ad3aeff1ce/92e1f/TL_LiftTalks_Storytelling_Blog_1500x1500_SE2.avif 500w,\n/static/1ff1703a7cf62105ae1174ad3aeff1ce/658d5/TL_LiftTalks_Storytelling_Blog_1500x1500_SE2.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/1ff1703a7cf62105ae1174ad3aeff1ce/0b151/TL_LiftTalks_Storytelling_Blog_1500x1500_SE2.webp 250w,\n/static/1ff1703a7cf62105ae1174ad3aeff1ce/33dd0/TL_LiftTalks_Storytelling_Blog_1500x1500_SE2.webp 500w,\n/static/1ff1703a7cf62105ae1174ad3aeff1ce/cd9a3/TL_LiftTalks_Storytelling_Blog_1500x1500_SE2.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1001}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/inventory-available-display-video-360/","title":"TripleLift Inventory Now Available Directly in Display & Video 360"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/how-media-spend-can-help-journalism/","title":"How Media Spend Can Help Journalism"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNDkwNQ==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNTA4NA==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDgzOA=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
