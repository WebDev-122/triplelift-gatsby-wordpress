If you have cookies blocked, or have blocked cookies from TripleLift, the opt out tool will not work.

The opt out tool cannot set this value if you have no TripleLift cookie.</p>\n<p><u>The opt out applies to the applicable browser.</u><br />\nWhen you opt out of receiving interest-based advertising from TripleLift, the opt out only applies to the applicable browser in which you set it.</p>\n<p><u>Opt out mechanisms of third parties.</u><br />\nSome of our publisher clients and advertising partners have their own opt-out mechanisms that are linked from their websites or their online-posted privacy policies. You should review the privacy policies of those companies for these opt-out links if you no longer wish to receive targeted advertising from a particular company, or multiple companies.</p>\n<p>Some third parties who use cookies when you visit our websites, also have opt out mechanisms either directly from their website or through an industry-developed web page.
