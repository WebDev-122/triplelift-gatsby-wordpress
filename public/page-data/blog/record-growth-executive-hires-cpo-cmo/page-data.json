Both roles were created in response to a record growth year in 2019 when the company achieved ad spend of $300 million (USD) and hired more than 150 new employees. TripleLift’s growth is attributed to the steady increase of new supply partners in parallel with deploying new and innovative advertiser products across channels — from desktop to television.</p>\n<p>“These new roles signal the next phase in what’s been a remarkable time for TripleLift. We have expanded our offerings, distanced ourselves from our competitive set and are poised to lead the industry on important issues,” said Eric Berry, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, TripleLift. “Both Julia and Jordan bring us deep expertise, but they’re also both passionate leaders who are eager to make an impact on our company and the industry. That aligns perfectly with our goal for growth, and our desire to make advertising better for everyone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As <b>General Counsel and Chief Privacy Officer,</b> Shullman sets the company’s privacy and public policy strategy by navigating the complex and changing industry and regulatory landscape. She has built a successful career working on policy matters, leading on issues around data use and privacy, while also promoting industry innovation, efficiency and trust.</p>\n<p>“Ultimately, what drives success for TripleLift is when people have a good experience with ads. That happens in part when we exceed regulatory compliance and provide levels of transparency and control to engender trust with consumers and all of our clients and partners,” said Shullman. “I’m excited to help lead TripleLift during this time of unprecedented regulatory and industry upheaval in its ambitious goal to modernize what has become an inefficient, complex misunderstood ecosystem.”</p>\n<p>As <b>Chief Marketing Officer</b>, Bitterman is responsible for TripleLift’s presence in the marketplace including audience definition, brand stewardship and activation of campaigns &amp; events. He is a well-regarded strategist and leader, has a background spanning both ad agencies and operating companies, and is one of the industry’s most dynamic voices.</p>\n<p>“The biggest insight compelling me to join TripleLift is that the company has been growing both top and bottom line financials — at speed — while still being a bit of a secret in the industry,” said Bitterman. “There’s a magic here that was so enticing to become a part of. What marketer wouldn’t look at that and want to add their contributions to help scale new heights?”</p>\n<h5><b>Rapid and Sustained Growth</b></h5>\n<p>This announcement follows four years of profitability and a six-month string of accolades that recognize the company’s rapid and sustained growth, including: <b><i>Business Insider’s </i></b><b>18 Hottest AdTech Companies</b>, <b><i>Inc. Magazine&#8217;s</i></b><b> 5000 list</b>, ranking No. 55 for advertising and marketing, <b><i>Crain’s New York</i></b><b> Fast 50</b>, which honors companies based on consecutive three-year revenue growth, and <b>Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500</b>, selected based on percentage fiscal year revenue growth from 2015 to 2018. The 2019 Inc., Crain’s, and Deloitte honors mark a three-year streak for each list.</p>\n<h5><b>About Julia Shullman and Jordan Bitterman<br />\n</b></h5>\n<p><b>Julia Shullman, Data &amp; Privacy Expert, Industry Influencer</b></p>\n<p>Previously, Shullman served in senior roles at Xandr including lead attorney for AppNexus’ Publisher Technology Group and most recently as Chief Privacy Counsel.
