As investment in video continues to rise, we are excited to enable advertisers to easily add native video to their digital media plan through The Trade Desk&#8217;s platform and are looking forward to growing this partnership through a combination of innovative native formats and finding the best way to make native in-feed ads beneficial for everyone.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional pre-roll ads, native video is an ideal medium to show longer videos, empowering brands with a tool for more amplified storytelling. Through the Trade Desk platform, the brand can execute native videos with a duration that can extend up to five minutes. The native video integration with TripleLift also provides a title, description, and location for the video alongside relevant messaging in a consumer’s content feed.</p>\n<p>“Highly targeted video ads in a native environment result in a better experience for the consumer, leading to higher brand recall and engagement,” said Jeff Green Founder and CEO of The Trade Desk. “Our integration with TripleLift offers advertisers the ability to deploy native video programmatically, incorporating more integrated and captivating content into their overall media plan, through one dashboard.”</p>\n<p>The Trade Desk is expanding its native offerings at a time when advertisers plan to grow native programs as a vital part of their broader media strategy. <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/Chart/Native-Advertising-Adoption-According-US-Marketers-Agencies-2015-2016-of-respondents/204002\">Recent research</a> found that 90% of US marketers and agencies have adopted or are beginning to adopt native advertising.
