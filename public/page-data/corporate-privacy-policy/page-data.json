To the extent that those disclosures may be different from the terms of this policy, those disclosures will apply.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we collect or receive information from a third-party, such as from a job recruiting site, your provision of and our access to information will be governed by those parties’ own policies and applicable laws.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Information we collect</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You may provide information to us for various reasons, such as to receive marketing information, to apply for a job, or to ask a question about this policy.

See sections below for European and Californian users.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>For users in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the laws of the EEA, UK, and Switzerland, certain data we collect is considered to be “personal data.” We may have certain obligations and you may have certain rights with respect to this data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>International Transfer</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift is a global company headquartered in the United States with data centers located in the United States, Europe and Asia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you visit digital content that uses our technology, your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in our facilities in the United States and other countries and by those third parties to whom we may transmit or disclose your information, as described above.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or equivalent laws, some countries may be deemed to not provide an adequate level of data protection for your information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we transfer data outside of the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, we ensure that appropriate protections are in place under European data protection legislation. These protections may include technical measures, such as removing personal data, or a legal mechanism such as the standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission. In case of any conflict between the terms in this policy and such mechanism, the terms of the transfer mechanism shall govern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Privacy Shield</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Privacy Shield Framework (EU-US and Swiss-US) is another mechanism intended for transfer of personal data from Europe to the US. On July 16, 2020, the European Court of Justice issued a judgement declaring EU-US Privacy Shield Framework invalid. We now rely on other transfer mechanisms for the cross-border transfer of data previously covered by the Privacy Shield. However, TripleLift has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Framework and continues to comply with its obligations under the program for data regarding EEA, UK, or Swiss individuals that is transferred to the US. You can find more information about Privacy Shield, including a list of companies that participate, such as TripleLift, <a href=\"https://www.privacyshield.gov/list\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>. TripleLift is accountable for information that it receives under the Privacy Shield and subsequently transfers to a third party. Triple Lift&nbsp;may transfer personal information collected&nbsp; as described in this Privacy Policy. TripleLift may also transfer other information that meets the definition of “personal data” in the Privacy Shield Framework to service providers and to its customers and partners, as described above. If we share personal data covered by the Privacy Shield with a third-party service provider that processes the data solely on our behalf, then we will be liable for that third party’s processing of such data in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, TripleLift may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift commits to resolve complaints about our collection or use of your personal information under the Privacy Shield Framework. Individuals who have inquiries or complaints under the Privacy Shield Framework should first contact TripleLift at privacy((at))triplelift((dot))com or:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Triple Lift, Inc., c/o The Privacy Team 254 36th Street, Space B633, Building 2, 6th floor, Brooklyn, New York, 11232</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Triple Lift, Inc.&nbsp;has further committed to refer unresolved Privacy Shield complaints to the ICDR (the international division of the American Arbitration Association), an international alternative dispute resolution provider. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint from us, or if we have not resolved your complaint, please contact the ICDR or visit https://go.adr.org/privacyshield.html for more information or to file a complaint. The services of the ICDR are provided at no cost to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under certain conditions, you may be entitled to invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted. See https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction for more information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over Triple Lift, Inc.’s compliance with the Privacy Shield Framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Role of Company as a Controller or Processor</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are located in the EEA, UK, or Switzerland, TripleLift may act as a “controller” as defined under applicable law when processing your personal data. We may also act as a “processor” as defined under applicable law to the extent that we process your personal data on behalf of and at the instruction of another party.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Legal Basis for Processing</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift’s legal basis for processing your personal data depends upon the specific context in which we collect or use it. In many cases, we will process your personal data based on our legitimate interests. These legitimate interests include operating our websites, managing our recruitment and marketing efforts.&nbsp; You have a right to object to processing the basis of legitimate interests. If consent is the legal basis, for example in certain situations when we send you marketing communications, we will obtain your consent and let you know how you can withdraw your consent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may contact us at privacy((at))triplelift((dot))com if you have questions or would like additional information regarding our legal basis for processing your personal data.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Your Rights</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be entitled to exercise certain data subject rights available under the GDPR or other applicable European laws. These rights may include the right to request access to personal data we hold about you. You may also have the right to object to, or request that we restrict, processing of your personal data. You may also have the right to ask that your personal data be corrected, erased, or transferred to another party.

The CCPA requires us to disclose to California consumers the categories of personal information (as defined in the CCPA) we collect, our business and commercial purposes for collecting, using, or selling such personal information, the categories of sources from which we collect personal information, the categories of personal information we have disclosed or sold for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding 12 months, and the categories of&nbsp; third parties with whom we share personal information. We have provided these disclosures in this policy. Note that the activities described in the policy include these categories of personal information defined by the CCPA: Identifiers, Other personal information protected under Cal. Civ. Code 1798.80(e), Protected classification characteristics/demographic information, Professional or employment-related information, Internet or other network activity, both precise and non-precise Geolocation data and, Inferences data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, under the CCPA, you may have the right to: (i) request access to your personal information and request additional details about our information practices, (ii) request deletion of your personal information, (iii) opt out of the “sale” of your personal information (as that term is defined by the CCPA), and (iv) to not be discriminated against for exercising any of your rights under the CCPA.
