It is no surprise that this shift has been a challenge for many companies to keep up with. TripleLift has always maintained a dedication to upholding a transparent, honest, and protected environment for all our partners and their audiences.

In addition to taking the necessary steps to ensure that our platform is 100% GDPR compliant, the TripleLift exchange has also undergone a full evaluation and policy review by the <a href=\"https://digitaladvertisingalliance.org/\">DAA</a> (Digital Advertising Alliance). We are pleased to share that the TripleLift Exchange has been granted 100% DAA compliance.</p>\n<p>The DAA is a group of organizations within the Advertising industry that have come together to develop and enforce a set of principles around data and privacy for consumers across the internet. Now, with TripleLift’s DAA compliance, we can be found in both DAA Web choices and DAA App choices opt-out tools. This allows for the end consumer to maintain a truly respectful and effective ad experience.</p>\n<p>Over the last few months we have taken every step necessary to work towards gaining DAA compliance and in the process have completely revamped our privacy policy to make it much more holistic. Though we have taken major steps in the right direction, this effort is constantly ongoing and we hope to continue improving the TripleLift Exchange to ensure the ultimate confidence of our valued partners and their audiences.\t\t</p>\n","title":"Privacy Please!

Native Video solves these challenges by combining the highest performing types of digital advertising (social, video and native) and makes it easy to scale across premium content sites. Native video enables advertisers to take advantage of the engaging nature of video and high visibility associated with Native placements.</p>\n<p>The success of Native Video is due in part to the benefits that this format provides in market:</p>\n<p><strong>Awareness and Recall:</strong> The most advantageous is its ability to drive brand awareness and recognition. Native Video provides advertisers with a rich, engaging canvas for displaying a brands’ message and when combined with a headline and logo further drives that brand recall.</p>\n<p><strong>Respectful:</strong> Facebook really paved the way for other players in the ad-tech space to explore sound off, instant play video. By carving this path, they have opened up an opportunity for other players to compete in this space. It not only creates a new set of inventory for publishers but provides consumers with a non-interruptive, unintrusive experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Scale:</strong> TripleLift has more than 1 billion video impressions available daily, allowing you to execute your video campaigns across the world’s most premium publishers.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy to Execute:</strong> Leverage the same assets you use for social video across the web, in TripleLift’s easy to execute workflow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TripleLift has built out three different video formats to help our customers run their video campaigns at scale and reach their consumers in the most engaging, respectful and effective ways possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marketing.triplelift.com/acton/attachment/22206/f-0647/0/-/-/-/-/TripleLift%20Video%20CTP%20Sheet.pdf\"><strong>Click-to-Play Video</strong></a>: Branding elements of in-feed native with the added capability of video</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marketing.triplelift.com/acton/attachment/22206/f-0648/0/-/-/-/-/TripleLift%20Instant%20Play%20Sheet.pdf\"><strong>Instant Play Video</strong></a>: Eye-catching sight, sound, and motion delivered in the feed of content once in-view</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marketing.triplelift.com/acton/attachment/22206/f-0649/0/-/-/-/-/TripleLift%20Outstream%20Sheet.pdf\"><strong>Outstream Video</strong></a>: Leverage existing video assets to scale campaigns and gain access to a unique set of TripleLift in-feed inventory\t\t</p>\n","title":"Sight, Sound, and Motion: TripleLift’s Native In-Feed Video","uri":"/blog/sight-sound-and-motion-triplelifts-native-in-feed-video/","date":"June 20, 2018","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNjc=","name":"Click-to-Play"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNjg=","name":"In-Feed Video"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNjk=","name":"Instant Play"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OA==","name":"Native advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNDU=","name":"Native video"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNzA=","name":"Native Video Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNzE=","name":"Outstream"}]},"featuredImage":null,"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyMzcz","excerpt":"<p>Last year we launched the TripleLift Native Academy to help you better understand the Native Advertising landscape and get more out of your native campaigns.
