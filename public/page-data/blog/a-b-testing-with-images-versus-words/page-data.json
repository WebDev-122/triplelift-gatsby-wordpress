Marketers usually focus on testing the copy, but it’s time to focus on the images.</p>\n<p>Optimizing the copy on a website, in an email subject line, or specific words in an ad is one of the most popular ways to A/B test.  But compelling copy can only get you so far. If you really want to reach new customers, you need to optimize the images to drive maximum engagement.  Why?  Because, as human beings, we are wired to respond to images over text – 90 percent of the information sent to the brain is visual. What’s more, according to a recent 3M study, images are processed 60,000 times faster than text.</p>\n<p>So don’t you think it would make more sense to spend time testing the images versus the words?  We do; so we tested optimizing the images in many of the native advertising campaigns we launched over the past 12 months.  In A/B tests, we noticed that <strong>ad engagement increased by 65 percent when a new image</strong> was tested versus simply changing and testing the ad copy.</p>\n<p>This is not to discount the power of words, but at the end of the day, subtle changes to an image will have more of an impact then fretting over what words to use.  Think about using different images to test with your content depending on your audience and see which images perform best.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\t\t</p>\n","title":"A/B Testing With Images Versus Words","uri":"/blog/a-b-testing-with-images-versus-words/","date":"February 24, 2015","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNTc=","name":"A/B"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0Nw==","name":"ad tech"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0OA==","name":"ads"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0OQ==","name":"advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1MA==","name":"agencies"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2MQ==","name":"analytics"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo4MA==","name":"Branding"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Mg==","name":"digital advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Mw==","name":"digital marketing"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1NA==","name":"Digital Media"},{},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMDU=","name":"image analysis"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2NQ==","name":"images"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMzE=","name":"measurements"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Ng==","name":"native"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Nw==","name":"native ads"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OA==","name":"Native advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OQ==","name":"nativeadvertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo3MQ==","name":"online advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2Ng==","name":"research"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2OA==","name":"Sponsored Images"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNTg=","name":"testing"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo3OA==","name":"Visual Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo3OQ==","name":"visual web"}]},"featuredImage":null,"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/ab-testing-with-images-versus-words-part-ii/","title":"A/B TESTING WITH IMAGES VERSUS WORDS PART II"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/3-key-elements-that-makes-a-native-ad-actually-native/","title":"3 Key Elements That Makes a Native Ad Actually Native"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyMTE2Mw==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoxMzUz","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxMzUx"}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
