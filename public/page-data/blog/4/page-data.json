TripleLift will use NewsGuard’s rating system to remove sites from its roster that do not meet acceptable standards of credibility. The agreement was made as a response to the increasing number of websites positioning themselves as news but instead operating in misinformation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The monetization of these sites has become a flashpoint in the advertising industry. The properties &#8211; sometimes referred to as <em>fake news sites</em> &#8211; have proliferated over the last few years, publishing opinion and conspiracy theories that are often confused by consumers as fact.&nbsp; Consumer advocacy groups have demanded brands stop advertising on sites due to their potentially harmful or hurtful content. The recent boycott by brands of Facebook has received a great deal of attention, but content shared on its platform actually originates from standalone properties on both sides of the political spectrum. TripleLift, which prides itself on offering premium inventory to its agency and brand customers, is actively working to rid its platform of these questionable properties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NewsGuard has worked with agencies and publishers, but this is the first time a programmatic ad exchange &#8211; or Supply Side Platform (SSP) &#8211; has struck a relationship. “In service of offering brand safe environments for buyers, we have been manually removing websites from our roster that we believe to be in conflict with appropriate news standards,” said Max Dowaliby, Director of Product Management at TripleLift. “But our core competency is building ad products, so at some point our decisions become subjective. NewsGuard gives us the ability to use a respected third-party system, managed by experts.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As a Supply-Side Exchange, TripleLift cuts checks to 3,500 properties every month,” said Jordan Bitterman, CMO of TripleLift. “We’re proud of our scale and how we help fund such a large number of premium publishers. Our partnership with NewsGuard is important to help ensure we do not monetize misinformation or hate speech, which is bad business, inconsistent with our company values, and in conflict with how our advertisers want to spend their dollars.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NewsGuard assesses websites based on nine criteria including: does not repeatedly publish false information, gathers information responsibly, regularly corrects or clarifies errors, avoids deceptive headlines and reveals conflicts of interest. The company employs a team of trained journalists and experienced editors to review and assign ratings. It was founded by Co-CEOs Steven Brill, who also founded The American Lawyer, Court TV and the Yale Journalism Initiative, and Gordon Crovitz, former publisher of The Wall Street Journal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The plague of misinformation that our society faces today&#8211;from health and medical hoaxes to toxic propaganda&#8211;is often unknowingly funded by programmatic advertisers,” Brill&nbsp; explained. “We’re pleased to see Triple Lift taking the lead among SSPs in ensuring that ad dollars spent on news content are directed toward trustworthy sources instead&#8211;using our transparent, humanly curated data about source reliability to do so with fairness, accuracy and transparency.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift will address their publisher roster each month based on NewsGuard’s regularly updated rankings. This partnership comes on the heels of TripleLift’s “Help Journalism” programmatic media initiative designed to boost the struggling news publishing industry which has been hit hard during the pandemic with sharply declining revenue in part due to a rise in advertisers’ excluding news and news sites from their buys.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About TripleLift</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift, one of the fastest-growing ad tech companies in the world, is a technology company rooted at the intersection of creative and media.

The company provides credibility ratings and detailed “Nutrition Labels” for thousands of news and information websites. NewsGuard rates all the news and information websites that account for 95% of online engagement across the US, UK, Germany, France, and Italy. NewsGuard rates each site based on <a href=\"https://www.newsguardtech.com/ratings/rating-process-criteria/\">nine apolitical criteria</a> of journalistic practice, including whether a site repeatedly publishes false content, whether it regularly corrects or clarifies errors, and whether it avoids deceptive headlines. It awards weighted points for each criterion and sums them up; a score of less than 60 earns a “Red” rating, while 60 and above earns a “Green” rating, which indicates it is generally reliable.

For relaxation, I love to watch stand up comedians, anything HGTV, and read trashy romance novels. It’s great escapism &#8211; especially these days on lock down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We’re sure that like everyone else, you had no idea this pandemic was coming. What was the moment when you realized that this was a big deal? Did you encounter any specific, significant work-related issues that you had to overcome when the pandemic started?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was on vacation in Mexico and they started to issue State Department warnings on the Hotel TVs. That’s when I knew this was very, very serious. We flew home March 20th and spent the next 3 months in quarantine.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luckily, we didn’t encounter many work issues. Our main challenge was to ensure our team was safe and healthy and stayed that way. We started working from home and have been sailing fairly smoothly since. We are being more flexible on work hours and when someone&#8217;s kid or pet shows up on a call- it’s embraced and enjoyed instead of seen as a hindrance. I’ve particularly enjoyed seeing my colleagues’ home life and have some major home office envy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Once you knew that Covid-19 would impact your business, what steps did you take to ensure that IBM Watson Advertising stayed successful?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am so proud of the steps IBM took. The Product team pulled together a knowledge hub of all things Covid. Using AI and the Watson Ads platform, we were able to produce a section on the sites and apps that provide local infection rates and trends in real time for every county in the US. The Watson ad provided crucial information on the pandemic, guides on sanitizing, staying safe and even offering ideas of things to do. We have been staying in touch with our clients to ensure we share the info we are producing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt it was important to take care of our staff and ensure they were doing ok through all this &#8211; we became more flexible, checked in regularly and began reinforcing the importance of self-care. We also reached out to partners to make sure they knew we were here for them, provided any optimization opportunities and any forecast data we could, given it was Spring storm season.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We went back to basics. We are constantly optimizing our mix of units, floors, and partners to ensure we provide a strong demand mix and quality ad experiences for our readers. When demand took a major hit in mid-March, we took a look at our ad footprint and reduced our capacity so we didn’t flood the market. We leaned in with partners to gauge where demand was still strong (like Video) and worked to provide them a path to that inventory. Having strong, mutually beneficial partnerships is key. Regular calls and updates with partners help ensure we can weather the economic storm together by capitalizing on opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How are you keeping your team engaged and do you have any tips for other leaders like you?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are hosting video happy hours where we do more than just talk business. Recently, we asked the team to share a few photos of a trip they took and talk about what they learned or enjoyed. It was so fun to see all the places folks have been. You get to really know your team by sharing these kinds of personal experiences. Having that personal connection is key in times like these. It has been a great team building exercise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clear deadlines and expectations of what needs to be done are important. Using Tools like Slack and text messages make it easy to facilitate individual check-ins and ensure everyone is doing ok, adjusting, and able to accomplish what they need. As I mentioned before, we are being flexible with work hours and encouraging colleagues to take time off to decompress. My best piece of advice is to be supportive of the employee&#8217;s whole life. Offer flexibility, support, understanding, and empathy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What consumer trends are you seeing on your site that have surprised you over the last few months? What industry shifts did you anticipate and which did you find surprising?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone loves the Sinkhole videos!! There’s not been one major trend that’s really surprised us. We were incredibly happy to see demand returning as early as it did in June as areas started reopening in certain parts of the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all expected the downturn in demand as businesses closed. For me the surprising part has been the number of companies that are surviving and innovating through all this. We&#8217;ve all heard that the Lumascape companies would merge and purge. We&#8217;ve seen some companies go, but I’m encouraged by those that are evolving and staying relevant. With challenges come opportunities. I’m excited to see what opportunities emerge in our industry for marketers and publishers as we move forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And finally, it’s 11pm and Netflix is shaming you with their “are you still watching?” popup. What show have you been binging?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tend to binge watch shows like Below Deck or Say Yes to the Dress as my guilty pleasures! I also love nature documentaries: BBC Nature, Nova, Nat Geo, and Animal Planet have heavy rotation in my channel selections. I’m a big Nature nerd!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>**For more information about TripleLift, our publishers, or how to be featured in a publisher spotlight, please <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\">contact us here</a>.</strong></p>\n","title":"Weathering Covid-19: How IBM Watson Advertising Navigated the Year’s Most Surprising Curveball","uri":"/blog/weathering-covid-19-ibm-watson-advertising/","date":"July 14, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToz","name":"Post Category"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/37c7a5eac61f216e5c87628b0de957cd/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlightSeries_Blog_2.png","srcSet":"/static/37c7a5eac61f216e5c87628b0de957cd/5add7/TL_PubSpotlightSeries_Blog_2.png 250w,\n/static/37c7a5eac61f216e5c87628b0de957cd/aef42/TL_PubSpotlightSeries_Blog_2.png 500w,\n/static/37c7a5eac61f216e5c87628b0de957cd/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlightSeries_Blog_2.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/37c7a5eac61f216e5c87628b0de957cd/98dbc/TL_PubSpotlightSeries_Blog_2.avif 250w,\n/static/37c7a5eac61f216e5c87628b0de957cd/92e1f/TL_PubSpotlightSeries_Blog_2.avif 500w,\n/static/37c7a5eac61f216e5c87628b0de957cd/9b3e4/TL_PubSpotlightSeries_Blog_2.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/37c7a5eac61f216e5c87628b0de957cd/0b151/TL_PubSpotlightSeries_Blog_2.webp 250w,\n/static/37c7a5eac61f216e5c87628b0de957cd/33dd0/TL_PubSpotlightSeries_Blog_2.webp 500w,\n/static/37c7a5eac61f216e5c87628b0de957cd/6429b/TL_PubSpotlightSeries_Blog_2.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNTM2Ng==","excerpt":"<p>In our last post, we provided a series of tips for advertisers looking to create an agile video strategy.

In this post, we continue to help you with more ways to solidify a winning video strategy.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shifts in consumer behavior that hinge on personalized, always-on access to video, across every screen, have made video the largest pool of online content according to <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/us-future-of-advertising-implications-core-modernization-models.pdf\">Deloitte</a>. Leading video to become the place where every ad tech provider wants and needs to be. However, too much of anything can be bad for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As video consumption continues to expand, the advertising market is beginning to shrink. Once known as the wild west of the industry, video is trying to combat the rise in fraud and change its reputation. Last year 44% of publishers told <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/digiday-research-44-percent-publishers-plan-work-fewer-ad-tech-vendors/\">Digiday</a> that they plan to cut back the number of ad tech providers they work with and will only continue using partners who can show substantial value. Advertisers simultaneously are looking for partnerships that can do more for less. The result has been <a href=\"https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/346864/ad-tech-deals-rose-72-in-2019.html\">mergers and acquisitions </a>of companies looking to gain scale or inventory advantages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Rise of Header Bidding</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advent of header bidding, gave every buyer access to the same placements at the time. According to <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/many-players-not-enough-choice-whats-driving-ad-tech-consolidation/\">Digiday</a>, this led to the commoditization of video supply, and created an opportunity for bad actors, an increased tech tax, and a suboptimal user experience. Now publishers are starting to take back control, cutting out unnecessary vendors as the industry makes way for a new wave of preferred partners. While no one partner can do everything, those that can provide a holistic offering will be better suited for preferred partnerships. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Know Your Source</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For publishers who are still vetting video partners, <a href=\"https://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2019/11/08/the-hazards-not-cutting-out-the-middlemen-programmatic\">The Drum</a> recommends accessing quality demand through existing SSP integrations. As discussed in a <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/us-future-of-advertising-implications-core-modernization-models.pdf\">Deloitte</a> study, video content creators who reduce their product portfolio and work with direct, “no-reseller” partners can expect to see a better experience for the user and greater cost efficiencies, leading to a happier buyer. TripleLift’s direct relationships with partners ensures publishers are getting more revenue for every buyer dollar, across a suite of video products like outstream, in-stream, and OTT. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Most Direct Path is often the Most Efficient</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For buyers, streamlining vendors is just as important as publisher’s minimizing their partnerships. However, viewer fragmentation makes this a bit more challenging. To keep up with shifts in viewer behaviors, buyers often work with many vendors and publishers, which comes at a cost. Buyers are now looking to these partners to help them navigate a space that is increasingly <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/advanced-tv-new-frontier-dsps\">confusing and convoluted</a> — those who can’t, are being removed. Having a partner that can provide access to a large amount of premium inventory, guarantee transparency, and deliver on multiple video strategies will make for good vetting criteria for the <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/many-marketers-are-looking-to-cut-vendors\">28% of brand marketers</a> who are looking to cut down on supply partners they work with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without streamlining video supply paths, buyers might find themselves with a hefty bill to pay. The video space has normalized expensive pricing models with CPMs upwards of $40. However, unless buyers are going straight to the publisher, 38% of their buy is eaten by the infamous “tech tax”. Finding an SSP partner who can streamline the supply path will allow buyers to significantly lower their CPMs and will provide publishers with higher revenue, making it easier for both parties to select preferred video partners. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Less is More</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assessing the quality versus the quantity of vendors available can help provide clarity in an opaque space. Opting for the most direct path to supply is a benefit for both the buyer and the seller, creating operational efficiencies for both sides. When assessing your video strategy, remember that less is more. </p>\n\n\n\n<h6>It’s time to solidify a winning video strategy.

These new features also require app developers to declare how they and their vendors use data and to update the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skadnetwork\">existing high-level reporting API</a>&nbsp;made available for attribution and conversion by advertisers and their ad tech vendors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, these are all welcome, user-friendly improvements. However, on deeper reflection, the announcements service to highlight Apple’s disconnect from the advertising industry—that its unilateral approach creates&nbsp;consumer confusion and has an anti-competitive impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Proprietary vs. industry-driven standards</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Transparency and control over the use of data&nbsp;in digital advertising, and accountability to prove support for them, are particular&nbsp;areas of focus for companies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of these new Apple privacy features appears aimed at empowering users with greater transparency and control over data collection and use. This is in marked contrast to other approaches, particularly by browsers, such as Apple’s own Safari’s Intelligent Tracking Protection, Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection&nbsp;and Google Chrome’s Privacy Sandbox proposals, which make privacy decisions for users without asking them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is, Apple is disengaged with the rest of the digital advertising industry, which is generally focused on designing collaborative, standardized solutions that can meet user privacy and data protection needs across different browsers, device makers, operating systems, apps and their vendors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Collaboration is hard, and it takes time&nbsp;to rethink&nbsp;industry interoperability.&nbsp;Even Google opened Privacy Sandbox to public collaboration and comment for two years, and now supports GDPR standards like IAB Europe’s Transparency and Consent Framework. Both decisions are likely motivated by commercial and competitive concerns, but are driving collaboration nonetheless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple receives a lot of public credit for its privacy features.&nbsp;But, its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/user-privacy-and-data-use/\">AppTrackingTransparency</a>&nbsp;and additional controls over access to its Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) look and sound a lot like industry’s collaborative, consensus-driven&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iabeurope.eu/tcf-2-0/\">privacy work</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;aligning standard data-use categories and user choice for GDPR and IAB, TechLab and other industry association work on CCPA, Privacy Sandbox and Project Rearc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Fragmented solutions</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Privacy is a fundamental consumer right, and consumers deserve standardized solutions which meet a range of user choices and data protection needs across all device makers, operating systems, apps and their vendors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These new Apple features come at a time when the digital advertising ecosystem is attempting to re-architect its systems and data-sharing practices to keep up with fragmented privacy regulations, user expectations and commercial product and strategic changes. Now, instead of devoting time to collaborative technical standards influenced by collaborative policy and legal alignment, the digital advertising ecosystem will need to divert resources to build for yet another proprietary solution—designed without their input or expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s specification is just different enough from other solutions—like&nbsp;IAB’s Transparency and Consent Framework and CCPA Solution;&nbsp;Google’s Consented Providers solution for GDPR and Restricted Data Processing solution for CCPA;&nbsp;Android’s Limit Ad Tracking solution;&nbsp;MoPub’s GDPR and CCPA solutions; proprietary “cookie” banner controls; and the standards set forth by the Digital Advertising Alliance and the Network Advertising Initiative—that companies have yet another standard to build to, and support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Consumer experience</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The launch of proprietary privacy features don’t just impact the road maps of businesses. Consider the user experience of moving between an increasing list of connected devices, operating systems&nbsp;and apps. Each presents a different (but overlapping) set of data uses and&nbsp;different choices to make, and each handles the transparency and control differently. The picture is fragmented and makes no sense. That experience can only lead to more confusion and demands from the public and, likely, well-intentioned but commercially influenced legislation to “fix” opacity in data collection, uses and choices in digital advertising. And, inevitably, the commercially influenced solution puts control in the hands of a few companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>A collaborative approach</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to push the industry to break this cycle of increasing fragmentation before we all lose credibility to do the right thing collaboratively. If not, only a few companies will survive, and publishers and advertisers will lose choice in the vendors they wish to use.&nbsp;The few survivors will be those&nbsp;that are able to build to these fragmented standards and somehow convince their clients, regulators and consumers that their solutions make sense and are legally compliant. We’ve already seen that support for multiple GDPR proprietary and industry standards is nearly impossible for companies and makes little to no sense to users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if, instead of developing its own interpretations and standards&nbsp;which undercut its app publishers, Apple promoted standard-setting work instead? What if, similar to Google, Apple supported technical standards work in privacy through its position as a device, operating system&nbsp;and app maker, to help the digital advertising industry be held accountable to user transparency and choice through an access-controlled identifier—and one which doesn’t just place power in itself or platforms?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if Apple aligned on standard definitions and taxonomies for data uses, and other major companies&#8217; controlling devices and operating systems followed suit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>User transparency and control over identity, data collection and use are broken, and are influenced by many commercial and strategic factors.

A mere 5 blocks and 50 odd years ago this was an epicenter of radical, paradigmatic change to which we can trace the modern origins of Pride Month. We owe so much of today’s culture and comfort to activists like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, who made themselves heard and would take no less than real change for an answer those years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 21st century has a short attention span and an even shorter memory, so it’s worth acknowledging some of the modern conditions we take for granted and how they came to be. One such reality is the increasing presence of historically underrepresented voices in mass media. Another is the expectation of progress and accountability that gives us confidence in a better tomorrow. Still more, there is the collaboration of so many millions of people across disciplines, identities and perspectives that make the internet a worthwhile place to be. These truths were built and fought for, and they require care and attention to remain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift prides ourselves on supporting the publication of high quality content wherever it happens to be. Our work would matter so much less without the passionate, diverse and inclusive ecosystem of publishers and advertisers we work with every day.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before this pride month is over, we wanted to acknowledge that we materially benefit from the work of all the LGBTQIA+ individuals who put their safety on the line at the Stonewall Inn demonstrations in 1969, and in so many countless ways and places in the many years before and since. The vibrant ecosystem of creativity and expression that drives us to consume content, challenges us to grow, and inspires us to build a better world has deep roots in Black Trans activism, in Black communities, and in Black imaginations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our future demands that we follow in the footsteps of Marsha and Sylvia in pursuit of a more just and equitable world — one we can be proud to live in.</p>\n","title":"Pride Never Ends","uri":"/blog/pride-never-ends/","date":"June 26, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3f2b96f2cd8ae1b24e195d35225c3944/8f3c3/blog.png","srcSet":"/static/3f2b96f2cd8ae1b24e195d35225c3944/5add7/blog.png 250w,\n/static/3f2b96f2cd8ae1b24e195d35225c3944/aef42/blog.png 500w,\n/static/3f2b96f2cd8ae1b24e195d35225c3944/8f3c3/blog.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3f2b96f2cd8ae1b24e195d35225c3944/98dbc/blog.avif 250w,\n/static/3f2b96f2cd8ae1b24e195d35225c3944/92e1f/blog.avif 500w,\n/static/3f2b96f2cd8ae1b24e195d35225c3944/9b3e4/blog.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/3f2b96f2cd8ae1b24e195d35225c3944/0b151/blog.webp 250w,\n/static/3f2b96f2cd8ae1b24e195d35225c3944/33dd0/blog.webp 500w,\n/static/3f2b96f2cd8ae1b24e195d35225c3944/6429b/blog.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"offset":27,"postsPerPage":9,"nextPagePath":"/blog/5","previousPagePath":"/blog/3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
