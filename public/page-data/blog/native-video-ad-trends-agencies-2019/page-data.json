Both are available as native formats within TripleLift and combine custom headlines and captions with sight, sound, and motion to capture a user’s attention. But now advertisers are increasingly moving toward more traditional video formats such as Outstream Video<strong>. </strong>This format acts similar to Instant-Play Video, but makes video implementation even easier because it automatically populates a standardized headline and caption — so advertisers and agencies don’t need to worry about developing specialized copy for each ad. This is a growing environment, with Outstream formats yielding 38% higher cost per completed view (CPCV), 34% higher viewable CPM, and 20% higher completion rates than Instant-Play video (based on TripleLift data). With Outstream, activating effective branded video in premium in-feed inventory is easier than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img style=\"max-width:100%;width:1200px\" class=\"wp-image-3618 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/6a6cae91fc97487d5f96b5e4751c6f38/outstream-videomock.gif\" data-reactroot=\"\"/>\n<figcaption>Example of Outstream Ad</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>More “Over-the-Top” Ads</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Cord-cutting has been a major trend in content consumption, and that is only <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2018/03/01/cord-cutting-record-internet-tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Cord-cutting has been a major trend in content consumption, and that is only accelerating as consumers shift away from expensive traditional cable models to connected TV and over-the-top (OTT) television experiences they can control.

Virtual reality has captured audiences and set a new standard in storytelling, allowing users an opportunity to feel they are part of the experience. Therefore, it makes sense that advertising stories will expand into more immersive and compelling formats. One way TripleLift envisions this taking shape is through the use of 360° Video, which allows a user to initiate a 360° video environment upon click — fully enveloping them in the brand’s story. This is often used for driving engagement and capturing user attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img style=\"max-width:100%;width:1200px\" class=\"wp-image-3617 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper\" loading=\"eager\" alt=\"\" src=\"/static/0ab71afa8baaf4c643f802e2ad097cb0/360-mockvideo.gif\" data-reactroot=\"\"/>\n<figcaption>Example of 360° Video Ad</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stronger Stories</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to video ads, the quality of the story matters just as much or more than the length.
