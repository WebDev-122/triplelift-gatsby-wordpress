We must nonetheless operate with guarded optimism and ongoing prudence given the continued uncertainty.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THE GOOD</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the pandemic hit, I wrote to this team that being disciplined would allow us to emerge in a relatively strong position. We moved very quickly to do just that. Our New York HQ closed on March 11th, and by April 2nd we had taken our major cost saving actions. In that time, we created a number of forecasts for revenue and aligned our expenses to reflect a new normal for the economy based on a conservative revenue model. As predicted, April was a bad month. May was better. June is better still. We will finish the quarter right around our target revenue model. This is something we should all be very proud of and it is a testament to the effort that the team as a whole undertook to adapt quickly to new working conditions and new demands from your professional and personal lives. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THE CAUTIOUS</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Achieving the target case gives us flexibility to take steps to ease many of the measures we instituted a few months ago. We currently have line of sight to positive EBITDA on the year, which is a feat given the environment that all companies find themselves in. That said: our business is highly dependent on Q4, for which we still have very little visibility. The current economic “recovery” we are seeing may well be temporary in nature, driven by the initial financial stimulus. It also has the potential to be adversely affected later in the year by the hasty re-openings in many states and countries &#8212; we are already seeing additional Covid infection spikes in some regions. This continued and extraordinary uncertainty drives our need to be vigilant as we move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>THE ACTIONS WE ARE TAKING</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even as we sit at the intersection of the improved indicators in our business and continued uncertainty in the global economy, the nature of our industry means that we must continue to invest in the future. Therefore, we are taking the following actions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Reverting Compensation.</strong> All employees who have had their pay reduced will see a complete restoration of their compensation to pre-Covid levels effective July 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Returning from Furlough.</strong> For the second time since we created the 3-month furlough program, we are bringing back employees. These colleagues play an important role in our plans moving forward and we are excited to welcome them back. When added to the colleagues we brought back on May 1, we have returned more than half of our originally furloughed population. We will be bringing back all of the furloughed employees whose skill set and expertise are aligned with a strict focus on our investments for the future, and we will unfortunately have to part ways with the remaining employees in our furlough program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>New Hires.</strong> We will move forward with opening a number of positions deemed critical to our short- and long-term future. In addition to our core business, we will make additional investments in support of key parts of our strategic roadmap. Two important notes. First, we considered our furloughed population for these roles and, where possible, prioritized those colleagues to fill them. Second, we will place an emphasis on finding candidates from underrepresented populations in our commitment to greater diversity, equity &amp; inclusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for your patience as we have navigated the last few months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","title":"Update: Discipline in Uncertain Times","uri":"/blog/update-discipline-in-uncertain-times/","date":"June 25, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"Our Operational Plan: The More Things Change, the More They Stay the Same","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/8f3c3/TL_pattern-shapes.png","srcSet":"/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/5add7/TL_pattern-shapes.png 250w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/aef42/TL_pattern-shapes.png 500w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/8f3c3/TL_pattern-shapes.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/98dbc/TL_pattern-shapes.avif 250w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/92e1f/TL_pattern-shapes.avif 500w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/9b3e4/TL_pattern-shapes.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/0b151/TL_pattern-shapes.webp 250w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/33dd0/TL_pattern-shapes.webp 500w,\n/static/d7545fe2292a6edd4fc3361ed7d52c29/6429b/TL_pattern-shapes.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNTI3NA==","excerpt":"<p>Thanks to its incredible ability to connect information to audiences, video growth continues to rise.

Today, it seemingly consumes every second of our day as it&nbsp;continues to proliferate new verticals, channels, platforms, and places and provide advertisers with more ways than ever to connect with people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While video opportunities seem to be infinite, there is a limit on audience attention. We’ve pulled together a series of tips for advertisers&nbsp;looking to create an agile video strategy that not only connects with their audience but can also withstand the test of time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Video is Versatile &amp; Complex: <strong>Find Focus&nbsp;</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the <a href=\"https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IAB-Video-Landscape-Report-May-2018_-4th-Edition_Final.pdf\">IAB landscape</a> outlines the variety of&nbsp; video options &#8211; content forms, distribution methods, devices and delivery platforms, and ad types. It shows the wide breadth of video but also proves the overwhelming complexity for advertisers, with over 1,000 possible buying combinations to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As more innovation is introduced, it’s important to focus your video strategy around your goal rather than a specific outlet. Consistent optimization of what available video options perform best for you will help create a focused video strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><span style=\"color:#f26839\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Tip:</span> Finding a partner who can do those optimizations for you will save time and money.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift continuously monitors and optimizes your campaigns. You share your goals and we’ll provide curated deals based on specific KPIs and filters, removing wasted budget, minimizing manual effort, and delivering better performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>New Frontiers Leave Opportunity for Bad Actors: <strong>Address Fraud</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>As new outlets continue to emerge, bad actors responsible for fraudulent activity are likely to be found. New product areas <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/digital-ad-fraud-2019\">where ad tech is relatively immature</a> have seen an increase in fraudulent activity. <a href=\"https://www.juniperresearch.com/press/press-releases/ad-fraud-to-cost-advertisers-19-billion-in-2018\">Juniper Research</a> estimates that buyers will end up losing $44 Billion a year to fraud, by 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gaming is a particularly lucrative opportunity for fraudsters, given the highly engaged &amp; sought-after young audience that is known to spend <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevinanderton/2019/03/21/research-report-shows-how-much-time-we-spend-gaming-infographic/#9df16503e076\">7+ hours</a> a day playing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on a <a href=\"https://blogs.oracle.com/oracledatacloud/how-moat-uncovered-an-in-game-advertising-fraud-scheme\">MOAT study</a>, there has been uncovering of bots spoofing gamers and collecting on virtual currencies and ad spend, unbeknownst to the gaming publishers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might be wondering why, if the industry knows that this is an issue, it is still happening. For video, where fraud is particularly tricky, buyers are known to demand more impressions than can be supplied by premium publishers, <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/digital-ad-fraud-2019\">according to eMarketer</a>, providing a delta for bad actors to prey on by creating illegitimate traffic advertisers will pay for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><span style=\"color:#f26839\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Tip:</span><strong><span style=\"color:#f26839\" class=\"has-inline-color\"> </span></strong>&nbsp;A direct supply path will not only help ensure that the traffic that you are buying is legitimate, but it will also help maximize your budget by limiting the tech tax. More importantly, ask your partners what they are doing to remove fraud before you bid on it. Working with partners that have a solution that validates every impression as human, ensures you’re only delivering your message to your desired audience.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Stomping out fraud with TripleLift is easy. With a no-reseller guarantee and a partnership with WhiteOps that verifies every single impression you bid on, you know exactly what you’re getting at no extra cost. We’ll even guarantee new opportunities like gaming and OTT where we continue to build our supply, providing you with new and unique inventory that is safe.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>Audience Habits Are Shifting Faster Than Budgets: <strong>Be Flexible&nbsp;</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>Audience behaviors are changing even faster than expected in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All areas of video are seeing increased viewership. Even linear TV, which had its worst quarter in history with over <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/q2-2020-digital-video-trends?ecid=dfda7bcd4b86471fba0d362c1f4a962e\">1.8MM subscribers falling off </a>in Q1’20, has seen a small resurgence. However, TV is estimated to decline post-pandemic as digital and OTT properties continue to encroach on time spent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, as live events continue to be postponed and canceled, live streaming/digital events are a solution for publishers to engage audiences and provide a revenue source. Live-streamed sports are expected to take off, with over 36.5 Million US viewers already watching sports digitally, <a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/in-the-us-people-are-switching-to-digital-for-live-sports-viewing\">according to eMarketer</a>, and expected consistent year over year growth into 2023. However, the sporadic nature of events like this can make it difficult for buyers to plan. In fact, US <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/q2-2020-digital-video-trends?ecid=dfda7bcd4b86471fba0d362c1f4a962e\">advertisers reported</a> that before COVID-19 they took 5 to 6 months to plan video campaigns but are now planning in half that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><span style=\"color:#f26839\" class=\"has-inline-color\">Tip:</span> To make the most of your campaigns and effectively reach audiences where they are watching at that moment, be flexible and work with partners who can help deliver on multiple video strategies &#8211; iIt will make it easier to pivot when needed.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding new and innovative ways to reach audiences is at TripleLift’s core. With a growing suite of video products available, advertisers can utilize proprietary or industry-standard formats that perform against a variety of KPIs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a buyer, having an agile video strategy will help deliver return on ad spend, drive legitimate conversions, and stay relevant no matter what trends emerge. <br><br>To learn how TripleLift can help create a well-rounded and efficient media plan, with a suite of inventive and standard video offerings, download the <a href=\"https://hubs.ly/H0sDJw00\">Programmatic Video Buyers Playbook</a> or <a href=\"/contact-us/?utm_source=int&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=video-part-1\">contact us</a>.  </p>\n","title":"How Agile is Your Video Strategy?

What does a Partner Manager do daily to ensure campaigns are delivering in full?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benazir: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to ensure campaigns reach their full potential we diligently monitor the campaigns and proactively reach out to clients as soon as any changes in spend are noticed. As PMs we need to know the campaigns inside out, from budget, flight dates and KPIs to all the DSP targeting overlay.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the campaign is live the most important part is to make sure creatives are approved and that we are hitting the daily budget. From this point on, monitoring and keeping in communication with the traders are the two most important parts of a successful campaign as a lot of times changes are made to campaigns that might limit the spend. If a campaign is consistently under-pacing and we are not addressing it the client is likely to move the budget without consulting us, so being proactive is always the key.</span></p>\n<p><b>Buyers seem to really connect with our deals offering.

This helps ensure the quality of the inventory as well as the brand safety aspect of the campaign which is one of the biggest concerns of any brand running campaigns programmatically.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Control</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Deals provide buyers more control over inventory and performance. We can add or remove inventory from the deal any time during the campaign as well as optimize for KPIs on placement level which is not available on the DSP side.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Ease of Setup</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; TripleLift deals are super easy to set up across all major DSPs. The most precious thing for a trader while setting up a campaign is time, and the simplicity of setting up a TripleLift deal using the DSP workflow makes it convenient.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Superior Service</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Most TripleLift campaigns on deals get constant and proactive support from a dedicated PM team who are always there to help set up and optimize the deals. This is something that buyers really appreciate as it helps them save time as well as make the campaign far more successful.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Finally, with all the product lines and capabilities TripleLift has to offer, what’s one thing you want your buyers to know about us that they may find helpful for their campaigns?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Benazir: </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I would like my clients to know that they should consider TripleLift not only as a partner but also as a trusted advisor whose support goes beyond campaigns.

Today’s installment features Thomas Yi, who is an expert on all things campaign management and what it takes to knock campaign KPIs out of the park.</span></p>\n<h5><a href=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/Thomas-Yi.jpg\"><span class=\"alignnone wp-image-4740 size-thumbnail inline-gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%;width:150px\" data-reactroot=\"\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"width:100%;padding-bottom:100%\"></span><img aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:0;transition-delay:500ms\"/><picture><source srcSet=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/82196/Thomas-Yi.jpg 38w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/ab49a/Thomas-Yi.jpg 75w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/4934c/Thomas-Yi.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\"/><img sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" srcSet=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/82196/Thomas-Yi.jpg 38w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/ab49a/Thomas-Yi.jpg 75w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/4934c/Thomas-Yi.jpg 150w\" src=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/4934c/Thomas-Yi.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition:opacity 500ms\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source srcset=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/82196/Thomas-Yi.jpg 38w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/ab49a/Thomas-Yi.jpg 75w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/4934c/Thomas-Yi.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /><img loading=\"eager\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" srcset=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/82196/Thomas-Yi.jpg 38w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/ab49a/Thomas-Yi.jpg 75w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/4934c/Thomas-Yi.jpg 150w\" src=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/4934c/Thomas-Yi.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center\"/></picture></noscript></span></a> Thomas Yi, Director of Campaign Management, TripleLift</h5>\n<blockquote><p>“From knowledge sharing initiatives, to updated collateral and everything in between, Campaign Managers are always seeking ways to improve efficiencies and processes at TripleLift.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>The Campaign Management team is tasked with making sure deals are running smoothly and delivering on KPIs. What’s a typical day in the life of a campaign manager like?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas: The campaign management team prides itself on being able to wear many hats. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally speaking, Campaign Managers will kick their day off with an organizational and housekeeping routine. Once finished with the typical housekeeping items like checking on emails, investigating ticket requests, and doign creative audit, Campaign Managers will jump into a range of requests: from generating tags and providing demo links for clients, to building RFP plans and decks, setting up campaigns, and investigating blockers and bugs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Campaign Management recently packaged up inventory for our Evergreen Deals for Direct Display launch. Can you tell us a little about how those packages are created? What goes into that process?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas: Through Triplelift’s partnership with IAS and MOAT we are able to measure the viewability of every placement on the Triplelift exchange. With this data we create inventory packages of placements that meet certain viewability criteria. After packaging this inventory to meet 50/60/70 percent viewability needs, we create Evergreen deal ids for each DSP integrated with Tripelift that make it easy for our clients and brands to target this premium inventory through any platform they use to execute their digital buys.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afterwards, we are consistently evaluating and refreshing the placements in each package on an ongoing basis.</span></p>\n<p><b>Campaign Management are troubleshooting experts when it comes to deals. What’s some practical advice you’d like our clients to know when running a campaign on deals?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas: Triplelift is proud of the fact that we are able to offer many different deal types across a wide range of our offerings. In the interest of time I will focus on best practices for Native performance deals.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set-up new deals for each unique campaign you plan to run. This ensures maximum performance as Triplelift will be able to send you custom inventory based on&nbsp; the needs of each individual campaign. This also allows for your Triplelift Partner Manager to assist with monitoring performance for any given campaign and make adjustments to inventory based on the performance data they are seeing on our end,</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to include the </span><b>full </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deal name when setting them up in your DSP. Triplelift deals will always start with “tlx” and be followed by 5 or 6 digits (tlx-54356).&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When setting up a seat deal, make sure to send over accurate DSP seat information to your Triplelift Partner Manager. If you are unsure of where to find your seat information within your DSP, reach-out to your DSP rep or dedicated Triplelift Partner Manager for assistance. t.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t set a floor. Triplelift performance deals do not have floors on them. When setting up deals in your DSP please make sure to set a $0.00 floor (or $0.01 in the case your DSP does not allow for $0.00)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communicate the below so that your Partner Managers can help optimize keeping in mind the variables that might affect your campaign:</span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;Accurate budgets and </span><b>all</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> targeting, audience, brand safety and/or viewability levers that are enabled on the campaign before going live.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KPIs and benchmarks for success for your campaigns.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Performance reporting (viewability, conversion, etc.)</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We thank Thomas for the expertise his team brings to the table.

Jen spilled tea with long-time friend, and TripleLift Senior Director of Sales, Rita Kline, while she walked us through a favorite recipe that has a lot of versatility: </span><b>Broccoli Tabouleh with Tahina</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Jen isn’t giving private cooking demonstrations or competing on Top Chef, she keeps busy with her Philadelphia restaurant, <a href=\"https://www.spicefinchphilly.com/\">Spice Finch</a>, and catering consultancy company, <a href=\"https://www.eatccc.com/\">Carroll Couture Cuisine</a>. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jen highlighted that in times when ingredients may not be easy to get, we should feel comfortable substituting fresh spices, meats and veggies. For this specific recipe, dill or tarragon could easily take the place of cilantro or mint. This flexibility and ability to deal with change is a quality that translates out of the kitchen, especially today. There are no perfect days, but keeping a positive perspective can navigate challenges gracefully. </span></p>\n<h5><strong>Quick Tips</strong></h5>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For meat eaters: when preparing a steak, season your quality cut one hour before and make sure your pan is very hot. You should also make sure the meat is at room temperature so it cooks evenly. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are vegan: treat any vegetable like a piece of meat. You can marinate, roast, grill or event rotisserie everything from spaghetti squash to pumpkin. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To avoid wearing goggles when chopping onions, make sure your knife is sharp and try storing them in the fridge. </span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When using the box grater, reserve the smaller sized holes for food that is more fibrous and harder for your body to break down. </span></li>\n</ul>\n<h5><strong>How Can You Help the Culinary Community?</strong></h5>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order take-out from your favorite local restaurant and if you are planning on booking an event in the future, try to do it now. Most restaurants are being lenient with cancellation policies amidst quarantine restrictions.
