One study observed that Americans check their phones every <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2017/11/08/americans-check-their-phones-80-times-a-day-study/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">12 minutes</a>, while <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/mobile-time-spent-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eMarketer</a> estimated that US adults spent an average of 3 hours and 35 minutes per day on mobile devices in 2018, with 86% of their mobile time in apps. <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/are-you-on-your-phone-too-much-average-person-spends-this-many-hours-on-it-every-day.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Inc.</a> concluded mobile usage may even be higher than 4 hours.</p>\n<p>And even when doing other activities, we&#8217;re still tapped into mobile devices — often using them as second screens when we&#8217;re engaging with other screens. The concept of continuous partial attention was coined by Linda Stone in 1998 to describe consumers&#8217; tendency to stay connected by continuously splitting their attention between multiple content sources. A recent <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/12/nielsen-the-second-screen-is-booming-as-45-often-or-always-use-devices-while-watching-tv/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Nielsen study</a> found that 28% of adults “sometimes” do this, while 36% report using second screens “very often,” and 9% “always.” But we turn to mobile most for our video content, too. Over 55% of the US population <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/mobile-trends-2019?ecid=dfda7bcd4b86471fba0d362c1f4a962e#page-deck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">regularly watches</a> video on mobile, and the average smartphone video viewer is <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/mobile-time-spent-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimated</a> to have spent 44 minutes watching videos on their device in 2018. Table users spent 38 minutes. Now in 2019, mobile is predicted to “<a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/mobile-time-spent-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">surpass TV</a> as the medium attracting the most minutes.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Phone-Stat.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-4019 aligncenter\" src=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Phone-Stat.jpg\" alt=\"State of Mobile Advertising 2019\" width=\"600\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n<p>The increasing time spent on mobile devices gives them the top position for facilitating human connections — and undoubtedly the area most primed for brands to connect with their consumers. After all, with smartphone users <a href=\"https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/micro-moments-consumer-behavior-expectations/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">50% more likely</a> to expect immediate purchases, it’s no wonder why <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/249863/us-mobile-retail-commerce-sales-as-percentage-of-e-commerce-sales/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mCommerce sales</a> reached 39.6% of total US ecommerce sales in 2018.</p>\n<h2>Advertising’s Year of Mobile Has (Finally) Arrived</h2>\n<p>If you follow industry talk, every year has been the “year of mobile.” Interestingly, though, 2018 was first year the numbers proved that. The first half of 2018 was the first time mobile advertising <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgoldsmith/2018/11/13/mobile-was-two-thirds-of-hefty-50b-in-1h-digital-ad-spend/#2d4270928125\">reached $31 billion</a> — amounting to 63% of total U.S. digital ad spend in the first half of the year. In that time period, native mobile ad delivery prevailed in ad spend, with 48.4% on phones and 6.3% on tablet, in comparison to 45.3% on desktop.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Blog-Graph.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4021\" src=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Blog-Graph.jpg\" alt=\"State of Mobile Advertising 2019\" width=\"600\" height=\"410\" /></a></p>\n<p>As digital video advertising reached $7 billion in 1H 2018, it couldn’t have been possible without mobile, which took <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/jillgoldsmith/2018/11/13/mobile-was-two-thirds-of-hefty-50b-in-1h-digital-ad-spend/#2d4270928125\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">60% of that</a>. eMarketer <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/mobile-video-advertising-2019?ecid=dfda7bcd4b86471fba0d362c1f4a962e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimates</a> that in 2019, US mobile video ad spending will reach $15.93 billion in 2019, and that $20 billion <a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/mobile-trends-2019?ecid=dfda7bcd4b86471fba0d362c1f4a962e#page-deck\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">more will be spent on mobile</a> advertising than will be spent on TV.</p>\n<h2>Pivoting to a Mobile-First Strategy</h2>\n<p>As consumers spend more and more time on mobile devices, advertisers and publishers will benefit from more frequent opportunities to engage with consumers anywhere. This, of course, means shifting budgets and placements accordingly, but it also means rethinking the way the industry advertises on mobile. Historically, this has translated into shrinking banners into mobile screens that are hard to read or interact with, or offering pop-ups that are disruptive and disliked by <a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-hates-obnoxious-pop-ads-heres-need-look-ads-site-280970\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">consumers and Google alike</a>. On the other hand, <a href=\"https://medium.com/ipg-media-lab/ipg-lab-sharethrough-exploring-the-effectiveness-of-native-ads-de8eb282f042\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">native ads outperform banner ads</a> overall, and they shine on mobile because of their ability to integrate seamlessly within the feed of content. When considering mobile formats, advertisers will need to get more creative to offer immersive, personalized ad experiences that encourage interactivity — in both storytelling and functionality.</p>\n<h5><strong>Get more insights.

The team will be led by Country Manager Kevin Delie, an early TripleLift employee who relocated from New York to Sydney in mid-2018 to oversee the company’s APAC business.</p>\n<p>“Kevin has built what was just a solo operation into an integral part of TripleLift’s overall global growth,” said John Stoneman, General Manager of International. “Several of Australia’s largest publishers are now clients and the ad requests delivered in the region number in the billions per month. We look forward to an even more significant expansion with the team we are onboarding there.”</p>\n<p>Delie, formerly leading the Publisher Development team based at TripleLift’s NYC headquarters, has helped hundreds of the world’s largest publishers launch and grow native programmatic offerings, including BBC, CBSi, Microsoft and many more, giving TripleLift the largest comScore-verified reach of any native platform in the world.</p>\n<p>TripleLift has brought on Penelope (Coleman) Lloyd to lead publisher relationships nationally for Australia and New Zealand. Lloyd brings a wealth of publisher experience, having worked at Disney, Seven West Media and Nine Entertainment Co. Most recently, she oversaw Domain&#8217;s transition to a programmatic-first strategy as their first programmatic sales hire.</p>\n<p>Luke Sroba joins TripleLift as Partner Manager where he will provide consulting and support for agency trading desks and DSPs across the region. Sroba spent the past five years in various roles at Publicis Media, first at Vivaki leading the Zenith and Razorfish programmatic operations and most recently as Product Director, responsible for programmatic partnerships and product development within the DTI (Data, Technology and Innovation) division of Publicis.</p>\n<p>Serving as Sales Director, ANZ, Ethan Robinson has over seven years’ experience with startups, including TripleLift for the past three. He started in New York as TripleLift’s first mid-market seller and grew to lead partnerships with some of the company’s largest global clients, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Estée Lauder, BMW and Coca-Cola. In the Sydney office, he will work with tech platforms, agencies and brands to enhance their native display and video strategies.</p>\n<p>“We’re focused on partnering with Australia’s most premium publishers, currently including REA Group, Domain, Gumtree, Mamamia and Interplay Media, and delivering more than 4 billion monthly ad requests in Australia and 500 million in New Zealand since a soft launch nine months ago,” said Delie.</p>\n<p>Amy Jansen-Flynn of REA Group said, “TripleLift’s solution has allowed us to seamlessly integrate native ads across the realestate.com.au experience. This has supported a more diversified programmatic product portfolio, helping us to deliver better overall solutions for our programmatic advertising partners.”</p>\n<p>TripleLift also credits its success to investment in buy-side tech partnerships including more than 50 DSPs. The Trade Desk SVP Mitch Waters said, “TripleLift has been an important partner for The Trade Desk on the Unified ID solution. We are delighted that brands and agencies in Australia will now benefit from a new native advertising platform and TripleLift’s shared commitment to increasing cookie coverage across the global independent internet.”</p>\n<p>On the agency side, TripleLift is working with local market leadership to bring progressive creative tools to brands’ programmatic strategies. Cadreon Partnerships Director Flaminia Sapori said, “Triplelift has only been in the local market for less than a year and they have been leading the way in programmatic native advertising with the correct balance of strong tech and high-quality inventory. We look forward to our continued partnership with TripleLift and to continue driving great results for our clients.”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Headshots-FINAL.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4040\" src=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Headshots-FINAL.jpg\" alt=\"TRIPLELIFT ENTERS AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND\" width=\"600\" height=\"690\"></a></p>\n<p><em>To contact the office in Sydney, Australia, please email <a href=\"mailto:anz@triplelift.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">anz@triplelift.com</a>.</em></p>\n","title":"TripleLift Enters Australia and New Zealand","uri":"/blog/triplelift-enters-australia-new-zealand/","date":"March 20, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMTI=","name":"Australia"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMzg=","name":"Native Programmatic"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMTM=","name":"New Zealand"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNTU=","name":"Press Release"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a1a8153d4dc6531e25730de2640df679/69209/032019_TLAustralia.jpg","srcSet":"/static/a1a8153d4dc6531e25730de2640df679/e9e8b/032019_TLAustralia.jpg 250w,\n/static/a1a8153d4dc6531e25730de2640df679/84742/032019_TLAustralia.jpg 500w,\n/static/a1a8153d4dc6531e25730de2640df679/69209/032019_TLAustralia.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/a1a8153d4dc6531e25730de2640df679/98dbc/032019_TLAustralia.avif 250w,\n/static/a1a8153d4dc6531e25730de2640df679/92e1f/032019_TLAustralia.avif 500w,\n/static/a1a8153d4dc6531e25730de2640df679/9b3e4/032019_TLAustralia.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/a1a8153d4dc6531e25730de2640df679/0b151/032019_TLAustralia.webp 250w,\n/static/a1a8153d4dc6531e25730de2640df679/33dd0/032019_TLAustralia.webp 500w,\n/static/a1a8153d4dc6531e25730de2640df679/6429b/032019_TLAustralia.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDo0MDAx","excerpt":"<p>Picture this: An intimate gathering of 50 leaders in advertising and marketing, sharing their insights and strategies in a non-competitive setting.

Sounds like a dream, right?<b> Brand Innovators</b> makes it a reality, hosting Marketing Innovation sessions for leaders to share knowledge that can help them improve and scale their businesses.</p>\n<p><strong>Trisha Tomaszewski, TripleLift’s VP of Brand Strategy and Activation</strong>, recently attended <a href=\"https://brand-innovators.com/marketinginnovationdallas0219/agenda-2-14-19/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brand Innovators Dallas</a>. Here, she gives us her top insights from the powerful event:</p>\n<h4><b>1. More than ever, now is the time for brands to be human and vulnerable.</b></h4>\n<p>“How do you develop a monogamous relationship with your consumer?&#8221; That was a question posed by Carlos Fonseca, Senior Vice President of Marketing Science, MetLife. A relationship may sound extreme, but as brands strive to differentiate themselves in the age of new media, they’ll need to feel less like a brand selling a thing, and more like an accessible participant in a two-way conversation. That means listening as much as talking, and responding with only thoughtful feedback. Discussions in the panel began to incorporate Brene Brown’s <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2013/04/21/brene-brown-how-vulnerability-can-make-our-lives-better/#1c4435f136c7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">power of vulnerability</a> — echoing the idea that being open can help brands build long-lasting trust with an audience. As President and Chief Creative Officer of New Honor Society, Heidi Singleton, best articulated, “We have a civic, or human, duty to care for the consumers rather than just sell a product.”</p>\n<h4><b>2. The next generation of CMOs doesn’t look like what you’d expect.</b></h4>\n<p>Because marketing exists within a creative realm, CMOs have often been considered mainly creative types — but we’re seeing major shifts in skill sets. As tech functionality becomes an intrinsic part of communication, more marketers are also experts in analytics and technology. Wade Allen, of Brinker International, serves as both the brand’s SVP Chief Digital Officer and CIO, focusing on the role that tech plays on the brand side and agency side. Each time a consumer interacts with a tablet in the brand’s brick-and-mortar locations, it’s an experience Wade was responsible for. It was critical for him to understand how other areas of the customer experience could make marketing more effective. For the next generation of CMOs, it will be critical to be a “utility player” — well-rounded in multiple disciplines like storytelling, analytics, and technology, and integrating them into your everyday work.</p>\n<p>Janelle Anderson, VP, Global Marketing for American Airlines, chose her role because she wouldn’t only be in charge of marketing, but also in charge of customer experience. For her, “marketing isn’t just a function. It’s all about customer experience.” Having insight in both departments strengthens the overall brand marketing and gives her more control for making sure they’re always in line.</p>\n<h4><b>3. Brands increasingly want to know exactly how their money is being spent.</b></h4>\n<p>For brands these days, overall results aren’t enough. As technology offers advancements in attribution, curiosity is driving brands to have deeper relationships with their agencies and partners. They want to know on a more granular level how their large budgets are being spent, and want one central place to monitor it all. This call for transparency isn’t about distrust, but rather about gaining deeper insight the brand can use across its business functions. Agencies should be ready to deliver on these asks.</p>\n<h4><b>4. When it comes to technology, “new” is less important than “focused.”</b></h4>\n<p>The typical, “What’s next in the industry?” question came up. But Trisha saw that often we have to reflect on the technology we’re using and see if it’s actually optimized to engage. Roshen Matthew, AVP of Digital Media &amp; Emerging Technology at AT&amp;T, &nbsp;encouraged the room to go deeper with technology partners and leverage them better, rather than focusing on always doing something new. John Stancliffe, Lead Online Marketing Manager &#8211; Video &amp; YouTube at AT&amp;T echoed that, saying that often videos can be made more effective by simply customizing not only the end card, but also different points throughout the video to make them actionable. Using technology should be a means to understanding how to anticipate and fulfill a consumer’s need.</p>\n<h4><b>5.

Interview by Trisha Tomaszewski and Patrick Wall of TripleLift.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Trisha: I’m super excited to connect. We get a lot of questions from both advertisers and agencies about why brands bring programmatic in-house and how to successfully execute in-house buying. I’d like to start by hearing your story and background. Did you know you wanted to get into programmatic?</strong></p>\n<p>Michelle: No I’m old, it didn’t exist. I enjoy data and learning trends. I&#8217;m inclined to look at the numbers behind things and ask why. Essentially, I have a natural curiosity that lead me to a role that is more numbers and trends driven.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrick: To interject, did you know you wanted to go into marketing? Did you have a degree in marketing?</strong></p>\n<p>Michelle: Definitely. I have a marketing degree and business background.</p>\n<p><strong>Trisha: How did you discover programmatic? Was it your first job, did someone approach you?</strong></p>\n<p>Michelle: I started in traditional marketing, there was no programmatic when I started. I started in TV, print, then email. Drifted into email compliance, paid search, campaign management and eventually programmatic.</p>\n<p>Erin: I don’t even have a marketing degree (which I might get shamed for) but I have a Master’s in Women Studies. I also like data and statistics and wanted to get involved in the digital space. I&#8217;ve had every job in digital you can think of and eventually came across programmatic about 7 years ago.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrick: Oh wow, early stages of programmatic!</strong></p>\n<p>Erin: One of the things I like about programmatic is that if you have the curiosity to teach yourself, the sky&#8217;s the limit.</p>\n<p><strong>Trisha: For people who are not familiar with what you do at Dish, what is your official role at DISH?</strong></p>\n<p>Erin: I am a Programmatic Manager on DISH’s centralized marketing team. Michelle’s role has been bringing programmatic in-house for the past 3 years. This past May we completed the transition for display and I joined to help with the execution and scale our programmatic capabilities to other business units at Dish.</p>\n<p><strong>Patrick: Do you feel like the dust has settled or is there still some growing pains of having that responsibility under one roof?</strong></p>\n<p>Michelle: Everything has been fairly smooth as we’ve built our own in-house agency for internal clients here. There are still some growing pains but that’s to be expected. We are however achieving our metrics with a lean team, added transparency and cost savings only two quarters into the process.</p>\n<p><strong>Trisha: It sounds like as DISH has brought programmatic in-house, you two have had to clarify what your roles and responsibilities are? What advice /feedback would you give other brands that want to bring programmatic in-house.</strong></p>\n<p>Michelle: Setting expectations with internal stakeholders about what this team will and will not be scoped to do. If a brand brings programmatic in-house to streamline costs and create transparency, then a trading team may be an excellent solution. If a goal is a behind the scenes view of everything happening, then consider staffing for more client facing (even internal client facing) roles. A person who enjoys being a hands on keyboard trader is not typically the same person who excels at Account Management. They are two different types of people and this is partly why setting expectations is so crucial to the success of an internal programmatic team.</p>\n<p>Erin: I would also say, investment in talent is important. DISH has set the bar high for wanting to invest in people who have already been in the programmatic space. There are a lot of different roles from traders, analyst, ad ops and others that an agency supports. It isn’t as simple as hiring a couple of traders and saying we have an in house programmatic team.</p>\n<p>Michelle: It’s also important to think about the right culture fit. Is someone going to thrive in a more corporate marketing culture vs. an agency? What does the career satisfaction look like beyond the honeymoon phase? The goal is to find someone who is skilled, not well read about programmatic.</p>\n<p><strong>Trisha: Where does programmatic buying fall within DISH’s marketing funnel?</strong></p>\n<p>Michelle: Our goal is to have a full funnel approach and bring in as many channels as we can. The goal is to drive more sales with the proper attribution model beyond last touch. When I started at Dish, viewability was incredibly low while partners were getting credit because they cookie-bombed and that wins in a last-touch model. As a brand, we were blindly trusting partners without looking into how they helped drive sales. Now we look at viewability and want to properly measure across the ecosystem, giving appropriate credit to everything from upper funnel prospecting tactics to lower-funnel retargeting.</p>\n<p><strong>Trisha: By focusing more on viewability, did your acquisition cost go down?</strong></p>\n<p>Michelle: Yes, our acquisition costs improved as we increased viewability.</p>\n<p>Erin: The attribution discussion is so important on the brand side. Brands should view attribution as a continuous dialogue. Changes and adjustments are always happening in the digital world and attribution is never fully solved for. Something we see at Dish is a constant need to solve it and then revisit it.</p>\n<p><strong>Trisha: Last year Buzzfeed broke a story about the FBI was investigating a fraud scheme in the digital landscape, with so many bad players, how does DISH avoid them?</strong></p>\n<p>Michelle: Our relationship with our DSP is incredibly important, we look to align with the top partners that provide complete transparency as well as ensuring we have third party verification in place as a double check and an internal audit team that is agnostic from our media team as a triple check.</p>\n<p><strong>Trisha: My last question before the lightning round is you buy Native and buy TripleLift. What are your thoughts on native?</strong></p>\n<p>Erin: I’m super excited that we’re able to tap into native programmatically, there is so much opportunity to explore it! There&#8217;s a lot that we can be doing with different types of creative (video v., display units) we’ve only scratched the surface. I think for the user it presents a really nice way to engage with a brand outside of a traditional banner. One of the things I look for when dealing with a native partners is how easy are you going to make my job? Triplelift has made it extremely easy to work, even in the complicated ecosystem of native.</p>\n<p><strong>Trisha: Great! Lets jump into the lighting round, Favorite podcast?</strong></p>\n<p>Michelle: Work related I like Behind the Numbers, there&#8217;s a lot of good tidbits.</p>\n<p>Erin: I&#8217;m going outside of work, I am a huge Two Dope Queens and I’m so sad it&#8217;s over!</p>\n<p><strong>Trisha: Facebook or Instagram?</strong></p>\n<p>Erin: Instagram all day everyday</p>\n<p>Michelle:..I have to say Facebook</p>\n<p><strong>Trisha: One thing you do everyday</strong></p>\n<p>Michelle: I run everyday</p>\n<p>Erin: I walk my three pack of greyhounds</p>\n<p><strong>Trisha: What should every trader know?</strong></p>\n<p>Erin: Don’t be content with current results.\t\t</p>\n","title":"Dish Network Leads Reveal the Keys to Successfully Transitioning Programmatic In-House","uri":"/blog/transitioning-programmatic-in-house/","date":"January 29, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OA==","name":"Native advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":null,"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDozODQ5","excerpt":"<p>We’re excited to reveal TripleLift’s very first Native Awards — a celebration of the best native advertising campaigns of 2018.

Meredith first tested this technology on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 2017, using the publication’s own content to bring a climb up Mount Everest (in 360<b>°</b> video) right into their audience’s palms. This blurring of lines between print and digital brings a whole new element to the idea of content consumption and interactive media.</p>\n<h4>Revolutionizing the Way We Ride</h4>\n<p>While the concept of the autonomous vehicles has been around for many years, the inside of the car is becoming increasingly important. Honda debuted a prototype of their <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A_3qtW06Io&amp;feature=youtu.be\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Dream Drive</a> infotainment system, which goes beyond streaming music and GPS by adding an in-car purchase feature. Drivers and passengers can purchase things such as food and gas without having to open their wallets. The Dream Drive also has a rewards system allowing consumers to acquire points by simply sitting in their car — reward points that can be traded in for gift cards for major retailers and restaurants like Amazon, GameStop and Dunkin. &nbsp;This infotainment system represents a new world of possibilities for revolutionizing the consumer experience in both transportation and content consumption.</p>\n<h4>Deeper Conversations with Your TV</h4>\n<p>We can’t discuss CES without bringing up voice technology. Voice capabilities have expanded exponentially over the last five years. While there’s an increase in partnerships between automotive and smart home brands, it’s TV implementations that will truly change consumers’ home behavior. LG announced that their 2019 TVs will <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/samsungs-2019-tvs-will-work-with-amazon-alexa-and-google-assistant-ces-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">incorporate both</a> Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. This will allow a user to treat their TV like a large smart speaker and remote control —&nbsp;all in a single screen, creating an experience that’s both visual and audible. This voice technology will also enable consumers to run visually enhanced skills, such as pulling up recipes or videos. While voice has been expanding, it has up to this point been used primarily for routine tasks, such as checking the weather or streaming music — leaving many brands unsure of the use cases for this technology. The incorporation of voice into TV opens up engagement opportunities for consumers, expanding the potential for brands to connect with their audience through a more dynamic medium.</p>\n<p>As a whole, new technologies are creating limitless opportunities for brands to engage with their consumers. Bob Bakish, CEO of Viacom, summed up the concept perfectly at the CES Entertainment Summit, “If you’re of the mindset ‘We have to only stay here,’ then you’ll never grow your business.” We must understand these new platforms and how they play into brands’ marketing strategies in order to deliver a better consumer experience — a fact that will drive better business impact. Now is the best time to look beyond metrics and focus on using technology to create true engagement and relationships with audiences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","title":"CES 2019: How Brands Are Using Technology to Enhance the Consumer Experience","uri":"/blog/ces-2019-brand-technology-enhance-consumer-experience/","date":"January 16, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMDA=","name":"CES 2019"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMDE=","name":"Consumer Electronics Show"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMDI=","name":"Consumer Experience"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":null,"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDozODI1","excerpt":"<p>Doubles down on innovating for user-centric monetization in OTT   TripleLift today announced via MediaPost Andrew Eifler’s appointment as senior vice president of product.

In this role, Eifler will spearhead TripleLift’s expansion beyond native programmatic into platforms and environments where users increasingly turn for content, including connected TV (CTV), voice-based AI, messaging, virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR), social, and more.</p>\n<p>Eifler’s hiring reflects the next chapter for TripleLift, which has led the growth of the native programmatic segment of digital advertising and which currently powers the vast majority of the comScore top 100 publishers. Eifler will oversee product for the company’s native advertising platform, as well as the recently launched ContentDial solution, which scales branded content for brands and publishers through an automated marketplace. Drawing on considerable industry experience, Eifler will also lead the company’s product extension into OTT, as TripleLift leverages its computer vision/image scanning technology for ad insertion formats.</p>\n<p>“Andrew’s work in video and algorithmically controlled optimization is extremely valuable as we capitalize on our momentum in the OTT marketplace,” said Eric Berry, CEO of TripleLift. “With him on board, we’ll be another step closer to providing publishers better user-centric monetization in all environments where media is consumed.”</p>\n<p>Most recently, Eifler served as vice president of product management for AppNexus, a Xandr Company, where he oversaw the concept, development and commercialization of advertising technology products used by global Fortune 100 marketers, ad agencies, and ad tech companies. An early employee, Eifler was instrumental in leading the buy-side product team at AppNexus, helping the company grow from 100 to more than 1,000 employees, launching video there in 2015, and facilitating AT&amp;T’s recent multi-billion dollar acquisition of AppNexus. Before joining AppNexus, Andrew was responsible for the DraftFCB New York’s analytics, attribution strategy, and media mix modeling as digital media analytics lead.</p>\n<p>“TripleLift uniquely understands what makes native advertising technology work and delivers premium experiences that are needed to engage smarter consumers. Through its image scanning computer vision, TripleLift is laying the groundwork for next-generation applications,” said Eifler. “I’m excited to join the team as the company enters this next growth phase.”</p>\n<p>Eifler holds a B.S. in Management and Business from Skidmore College, where he earned the Seymour and Sylvia Goldman Memorial Prize, which is awarded to the top student in Management and Business. He is also a regular guest speaker at NYU and Skidmore College, informing the communities about advertising technology and its potential. In addition, Eifler has served as judge and mentor for the Kenneth A. Freirich business plan competition at Skidmore College and mentors small businesses that emerge in verticals such as spirits, publishing, and human resources, among others.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Click <a href=\"https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/330299/triplelift-taps-former-appnexus-exec-eifler-to-spe.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a> to see MediaPost’s coverage.</em></strong>\t\t</p>\n","title":"TripleLift Names Leading Product Executive  Andrew Eifler as SVP","uri":"/blog/triplelift-names-leading-product-executive-andrew-eifler-svp/","date":"January 09, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxOTg=","name":"Andrew Eifler"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNDc=","name":"Announcement"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNTU=","name":"Press Release"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxOTk=","name":"Press Release"}]},"featuredImage":null,"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"offset":90,"postsPerPage":9,"nextPagePath":"/blog/12","previousPagePath":"/blog/10"}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
