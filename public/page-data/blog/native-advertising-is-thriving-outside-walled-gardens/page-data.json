Bringing their own audiences, inventory and data, walled gardens initially fulfilled advertisers’ needs, but that also came with a host of drawbacks that negatively impacted ad performance — causing many brands to look elsewhere.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The good news: The future of advertising will thrive outside these walls.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Recent studies have shown that non-social native ad growth outpaces overall native growth. That data inspired TripleLift to conduct our own research and we recently published these findings in our </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/native-programmatic-trends-report-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Native Programmatic Trends Report 1H 2018</span></a>,<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which includes a study of TripleLift’s first-party data, third-party data including reporting provided to TripleLift, and industry reports and forecasts. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below, we analyze why social is lagging, why non-social is accelerating, and what that means for your advertising strategy.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Why the Walls Are Crumbling</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When considering native ads, there’s a major distinction between social and non-social:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social Native displays within walled gardens like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Google, etc.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-Social Native displays in the open market.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because walled gardens led to the proliferation of in-feed ads, there’s been a longstanding assumption that they were the gatekeepers to successful native campaigns. But brands quickly noticed how a lack of controls within these platforms also led to limited audience targeting, or their ads appearing next to offensive or irrelevant content. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">49% of consumers find advertising on Facebook annoying. &#8211; <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/718480/us-consumer-opinion-facebook-advertising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Statista</a>, June 2017</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not just brands who are feeling the burn. Anyone paying even a bit of attention to news reels can see that walled gardens don’t have the growth power they once held. They’ve faced everything from </span><a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/facebook-data-privacy-scandal-a-cheat-sheet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">data scandals</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to declines in user growth and engagement </span><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/technology/snapchat-users.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">across major social platforms</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Without a strong and active user base, walled gardens have little to offer advertisers.</span></p>\n<h4><b>Open Markets Offer Fertile Ground</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, non-social native growth rate is healthy and growing.</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A recent </span><a href=\"https://content-na1.emarketer.com/us-native-digital-display-advertising-forecast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">eMarketer study</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> showed a 31% total native growth rate in 2018 (19% higher than in 2017). While this is good news for native overall, it’s completely overshadowed by non-social native growth, which showed a </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/native-programmatic-trends-report-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">62% growth rate</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><b>That’s 2x the overall growth rate.</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As most digital display advertising is losing value or remaining steady, there’s much to gain from non-social native in the open marketplace for advertisers and publishers alike.</span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/nonsocial-growth-chart_1000x559px.png\"><span class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3548

growth?</b></h4>\n<p>There are a number of factors contributing to the growth of non-social native.</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consumer Behavior: Users aren’t engaging less online overall, but rather shifting their engagement from walled gardens to publishers and platforms in the open market that deliver the content they want most.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Better Ad Controls: Access to premium inventory means better advertising placements and stronger targeting capabilities with genuinely engaged audiences.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Native Video: New developments in native video led to a 61% growth in </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/native-programmatic-trends-report-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">non-social native video spend</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> year over year.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Non-Social Mobile Engagement: As consumers spend more and more time on mobile devices — and more time on these devices than any other — advertising spend on phone and tablets have exceeded spend on desktop.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><b>What does this mean for advertising in the future?</b></h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Relying heavily on walled gardens can mean major missed opportunities in the native landscape. Instead, it’s important to consider how native programmatic in the open market can give you the best of many worlds: beautiful in-feed native ads, transparency into placements and data, access to premium publishers and controls over adjacency, and audience quality and diversity. If you haven’t doubled down on non-social native, now’s the time to do so.</span></p>\n<h5><strong>Get more on non-social native and the latest industry trends in our <a href=\"https://bit.ly/native-programmatic-trends-report-2018\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Native Programmatic Trends Report</a>.</strong></h5>\n","title":"Why Native Is Thriving Outside Walled Gardens","uri":"/blog/native-advertising-is-thriving-outside-walled-gardens/","date":"November 19, 2018","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxODk=","name":"2018 Native Programmatic Trends"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OA==","name":"Native advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxOTA=","name":"Non-social Native Ads"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxOTE=","name":"Walled Gardens"}]},"featuredImage":null,"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/native-video-ad-trends-agencies-2019/","title":"Native Video Ad Trends Agencies Should Expect in 2019"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/triplelift-launches-contentdial-scale-branded-content/","title":"TripleLift Introduces ContentDial: Get Ready to Scale Your Branded Content"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNTU4","previousPostId":"cG9zdDozNjA1","nextPostId":"cG9zdDozMzk0"}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
