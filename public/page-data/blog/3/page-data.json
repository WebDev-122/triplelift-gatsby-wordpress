Every month we’ll share an interview with one of our premium publishers, highlighting unique stories and uncovering valuable insights. This week we’re speaking with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexmmason/\"><strong>Alex Mason, Senior Director, Yield &amp; Programmatic Operations</strong> <strong>at Complex</strong></a>. Read on to learn about Complex’s recent partnerships, their efforts to shine the light on important issues (like voting) to Gen Z and millennial audiences, and some “hidden gems” from Alex to shake up your usual content consumption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Excited to hear more about Complex, thanks for chatting with us Alex. For starters, can you tell us a bit about what you do?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks for having me! I head up programmatic and yield for Complex Networks, which includes Catalyst, our B2B initiative providing yield and revenue ops solutions for other publishers. It’s a lot of ad tech management and data analysis, my two favorite things, but I just tell my parents I make sure the ads show up on our sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How has Complex evolved from a portfolio perspective since you’ve been at the company?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The portfolio itself hasn’t changed too much, but our monetization strategy across Catalyst has. Beyond our O&amp;O properties (Complex, First We Feast, Sole Collector, Pigeons &amp; Planes), we represent 40+ publishers in categories endemic to Complex like music, pop-culture, sneakers/fashion, and sports. A majority of these publishers have actually been with us for many years, but it wasn’t until recently that we formalized Catalyst as a product offering and became set on expanding. We’ve spent the last year rebuilding our ad stack from the ground up, optimizing deal workflows, expanding our analytical capabilities, and turning things off and back on again, all of which have proven to be beneficial projects for our Catalyst publishers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you have plans to add more sites any time soon?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. Since it was announced earlier this year, we’ve added a few new publishers,<a href=\"https://www.blastbeatnetwork.com/\"> Blastbeat Network</a> being the latest, which consists of sites such as<a href=\"https://metalinjection.net/\"> Metalinjection.net</a> and Metalsucks.net. In addition to the websites we work with, we also provide in-app solutions and represent a wide range of YouTube creators, so partnerships of all shapes and sizes are welcome. At the end of the day, we’re a publisher looking to extend our monetization expertise and resources to other publishers, so I’m excited to see Catalyst grow. For those interested, we accept inquiries at<a href=\"https://complexcatalyst.com/\"> https://complexcatalyst.com/</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It looks like a lot of those sites center around rock and heavy metal music &#8211; is there a strategic reason behind those partnerships?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>More of a coincidence than a strategy to corner the heavy music market, though that sounds fun. Music is a category that we already cover pretty extensively, so being able to add 8 sites that specialize in a genre with a dedicated audience just makes sense. While our partners have historically fit into one or more of the categories I mentioned above, I’d like to see us branch out into new areas or expand on already existing ones like gaming and current affairs/news. We have a large audience with a wide array of interests, and I believe it’ll be beneficial to build up our contextual categories as we get closer to the cookie-ocalypse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you noticed any interesting trends in any of Complex’s areas of focus due to Covid-19?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For sure. Specifically on the content side of things, having to quarantine pushed us to experiment with new franchises we probably otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have tried. In some cases they were completely original, drawing from our expertise in areas like food or sneakers, while others were extensions of existing IP like Hot Ones&#8230; 10+ series in all and featuring big-name talent like Tracy Morgan, Issa Rae, G-Eazy, and more. Some were even shared with brand partners, like HP, who we worked with on new series Sneaker Battles and DIY Closets. What we found when surveying the industry is that 90% of respondents said remote production wouldn&#8217;t deter them from watching our content so long as it was still interesting and entertaining &#8212; two qualities we consistently deliver on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently though, we announced our first free, open-world, virtual experience called ComplexLand. It’ll feature 5 days of shopping, merch drops, discussions, music, and food, and will be coming to mobile and desktop browsers December 7 &#8211; 11 at ComplexLand.com. We’re taking our annual convention ComplexCon to our audience and I for one am excited to give my avatar a fresh fit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who primarily works on a laptop in Excel crunching numbers, it’s been cool to see the innovation. I want to give a big shoutout to everyone involved in the production, execution, delivery, success, and everything else that goes into the creation of these ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are some of your “hidden gems” of Complex &#8211; the types of content that people may not expect when they think about you, but they should definitely check out?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone should check out<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q13a5UuD9gY&amp;list=PLfv8hhuTqJGZ2E4GV_xgd7SVRpm8Sjeu_\"> Complex World</a>, our youth culture current affairs docuseries which has put out new episodes biweekly since April. The Complex World team has done incredible work covering some of today’s most important issues, such as<a href=\"https://www.complex.com/life/2020/06/why-voting-matters-and-how-some-people-try-to-stop-it\"> voter suppression</a>,<a href=\"https://www.complex.com/life/2020/08/how-21-savage-young-people-are-fighting-for-immigration-reform\"> immigration reform</a>, and<a href=\"https://www.complex.com/life/2020/08/climate-of-change-how-to-vote-against-environmental-racism\"> environmental racism</a>, in a voice that resonates with our largely Gen Z and millennial audience. To me, it’s been a standout, fresh take from the other news providers taking up my feed, and seeing a new episode becomes a highlight of my week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also just launched<a href=\"https://www.complex.com/pull-up-and-vote/\"> Pull Up &amp; Vote</a>, a new company-wide initiative to educate and motivate our large, young, and diverse audience to check their registration, double-check if they’re unsure, and to make a plan for how they’ll vote in this 2020 presidential election. We’re providing vital information and resources to our audience like how to vote by mail, how to find your polling place, and where both candidates stand on the most salient issues for young voters. It’s great working for a company that uses its resources and reach to support important causes, especially right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Last question &#8211; it’s time to tackle that major project and you need the perfect tunes to get in the zone. What are you turning on?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m turning on my streaming service of choice’s “Rap Bangers” playlist or some older pop-punk like Alkaline Trio. I need some energy while I’m working and either of those will do it for me. Some new albums I’ve been listening to a lot lately are SuperGood by Duckwrth and In Sickness &amp; In Flames by The Front Bottoms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>For more information about TripleLift, our publishers, or how to be featured in a publisher spotlight, please&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\">contact us here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n","title":"From Magazine to Global Entertainment Network: How Complex Networks is Diversifying Their Business","uri":"/blog/how-complex-is-diversifying-their-business/","date":"October 13, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/efa180130b5cc2790c9512f3d0f440ee/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo-1-1.png","srcSet":"/static/efa180130b5cc2790c9512f3d0f440ee/5add7/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo-1-1.png 250w,\n/static/efa180130b5cc2790c9512f3d0f440ee/aef42/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo-1-1.png 500w,\n/static/efa180130b5cc2790c9512f3d0f440ee/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo-1-1.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/efa180130b5cc2790c9512f3d0f440ee/98dbc/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo-1-1.avif 250w,\n/static/efa180130b5cc2790c9512f3d0f440ee/92e1f/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo-1-1.avif 500w,\n/static/efa180130b5cc2790c9512f3d0f440ee/9b3e4/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo-1-1.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/efa180130b5cc2790c9512f3d0f440ee/0b151/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo-1-1.webp 250w,\n/static/efa180130b5cc2790c9512f3d0f440ee/33dd0/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo-1-1.webp 500w,\n/static/efa180130b5cc2790c9512f3d0f440ee/6429b/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo-1-1.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNTk4Nw==","excerpt":"<p>Last month, TripleLift launched our Underrepresented Voices offering, enabling our advertisers to run across our premium publishers that are majority owned by People of Color, Women, and members of the LGBTQ+ community.

Every month we’ll share an interview with one of our premium publishers, highlighting unique stories and uncovering valuable insights. This week, we’re speaking with<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicholas-hermansader-a26aa39/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> Nick Hermansader, Senior Vice President of Advertising at The Meet Group</a>. Read on to learn about how The Meet Group is rewarding both users and advertisers alike (literally).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thanks for sitting down with us Nick. We’d love to learn a bit about you &#8211; can you tell us about your role at The Meet Group?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely, thanks for having me. I lead advertising at The Meet Group for our US based dating and livestreaming apps MeetMe, Skout, Tagged and GROWLr. Each app caters to a slightly different audience, but the end goal is the same &#8211; bring people together to meet, socialize, and have fun in a safe, online environment. That’s more important now than ever before. We’re meeting the universal need for human connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What do you love most about working from home? How have you kept your team engaged and motivated while remote?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s certainly been an adjustment and was a struggle to balance work, life, and family at the beginning but we’ve since hit our stride. My favorite part is when I’m working in my basement office and my two year-old sneaks down to show me an art project he made or (most recently) brings me a pizza bagel that he and mom made for lunch. I definitely don’t get those moments at the office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has adjusted incredibly well. We were already partially remote with team members spread out across the country and the globe, so it was rather seamless. We still hold our regular meetings virtually and we have weekly coffee breaks where we talk about the latest TV and movies or play a quick online game for some fun competition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>While we’re on the topic of love, what are some of the activities that you’ve enjoyed while at home?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Surprisingly, I think we’ve watched less TV than before quarantine. Staying at home has forced us to spend more time outdoors since we’re inside working all day. In fact, we took the opportunity back in May to rent a house in South Carolina and isolate there for a month. My parents joined us to help take care of our son so we could focus on work during the day. It turned out to be a wonderful experience that wouldn’t have happened otherwise. He got to spend more time with his grandparents than he ever would have and we got a lot of time together on long walks and spending time together outdoors while the weather was still a</p>\n\n\n\n<p>bit chilly up here in the Northeast. Other than making sure I was caught up on the Chicago Bulls documentary, The Last Dance, we didn’t have the television on much at all down there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you seen more app downloads/user engagement during the pandemic, or less?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have seen unprecedented engagement during the pandemic, especially within our livestreaming product. All of us have been searching for ways to break up the monotony and boredom of quarantine, much of which is caused by our inability to socialize in person. Our products enable our users to do just that. Not only can they discover others to chat with, but in Live, they can actually see and talk to those people virtually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Meet Group is one of the largest providers of livestreaming dating games in the world. We have been experiencing over 195,000 dating games played each day across our apps, an increase of 104% since the declaration of a global pandemic in March. At the start of the pandemic, video was a replacement for real-life interaction. Now that things have opened up a bit more, it is a filter to screen potential dates for connection and compatibility before meeting in person. Daters are increasingly demanding a video chat first, to prequalify potential dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are some of the advantages for advertisers of working with The Meet Group versus other publishers in your competitive set?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost is scale and diversity. We’re managing over 10 billion impressions per month across the US portfolio of apps. Our users are coming back every day and this provides a great opportunity for advertisers to consistently get their message across. We also offer many different audiences with the various apps whether it’s US-centric (MeetMe), internationally-focused (Skout), African American (Tagged), or the gay community (GROWLr). Additionally, we have a great first-party data set because 100% of our active users are logged in. This is the way the industry is trending so publisher-owned data is only going to get more valuable as cookies and mobile ad IDs are being deprecated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Does The Meet Group have any new and exciting offerings that advertisers should know about?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have traditionally offered standard mobile ad products due to our size and reliance on open exchange demand. However, our livestreaming platform has allowed us to expand into other products &#8211; the largest of which is rewarded video. The influx of in-app purchases in Live has enabled us to introduce this opt-in ad experience in which a user voluntarily watches a video ad and receives in-app currency for doing so. It is great for the users because it gives them an opportunity to participate in the economy of Live without having to make a cash purchase. They feel included and it may even encourage them to make a purchase in the future. Advertisers benefit because the user is actively choosing to engage with their brand instead of it being forced in front of it. They may even form a positive subconscious association between the brand and the reward they received.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re also exploring unique ways for brands to incorporate into Live. The in-app currency is used to purchase virtual gifts so I believe there is an opportunity for brands to sponsor these items. It would not only elevate the perceived value of the gift to have a brand name on it, but the sponsorship itself could subsidize the cost for users so they don’t have to pay out of pocket for it &#8211; creating more good faith for the advertiser and possibly encouraging future purchases from users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>For more information about TripleLift, our publishers, or how to be featured in a publisher spotlight, please&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\">contact us here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n","title":"Human Connection in a Time of Social Distancing: A Conversation with The Meet Group","uri":"/blog/publisher-spotlight-the-meet-group/","date":"September 15, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/461db11c539a4fca94f981458ba6f595/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_v2_SE2-1.png","srcSet":"/static/461db11c539a4fca94f981458ba6f595/5add7/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_v2_SE2-1.png 250w,\n/static/461db11c539a4fca94f981458ba6f595/aef42/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_v2_SE2-1.png 500w,\n/static/461db11c539a4fca94f981458ba6f595/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_v2_SE2-1.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/461db11c539a4fca94f981458ba6f595/98dbc/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_v2_SE2-1.avif 250w,\n/static/461db11c539a4fca94f981458ba6f595/92e1f/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_v2_SE2-1.avif 500w,\n/static/461db11c539a4fca94f981458ba6f595/9b3e4/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_v2_SE2-1.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/461db11c539a4fca94f981458ba6f595/0b151/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_v2_SE2-1.webp 250w,\n/static/461db11c539a4fca94f981458ba6f595/33dd0/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_v2_SE2-1.webp 500w,\n/static/461db11c539a4fca94f981458ba6f595/6429b/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_v2_SE2-1.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNjQ5OA==","excerpt":"<p>As the election draws near and the political season hits its apex, we want to clarify our position on political advertising.

This topic has become a hot button issue for our industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift accepts political ads from major party candidates at both the national and state levels of government. In our business, we can either accept ads from <em>all</em> major parties or choose not to accept ads from <em>all</em> major parties. We cannot ethically refuse ads from a legitimate party just because we don&#8217;t agree with their platform or politics. If we did, we would become ultimate arbiters of truth or policy in the name of democracy and we cannot, in good faith, take on that role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have put practices in place to govern our actions. Those practices are as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Limit PAC Spending.</strong> We will closely monitor advertisers known as Political Action Committees. PACs were given great latitude by the U.S. Supreme Court case known as Citizens United to spend large sums of money in support of candidates and causes. No company is under obligation to accept that advertising. We will apply our own judgement and accept and reject PAC money as we see fit. If we believe any particular PAC advertising promotes hate speech or misinformation, we will apply a human lens to reject or remove that advertiser from our platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Encourage Publisher Tools. </strong>We provide tools to our publishers for them to make decisions on the advertising they wish to accept &#8212; political or otherwise.&nbsp; We have recently sent a communication to all of our publishers, reinforcing the existence of these tools and educating them on how to apply their own filters of acceptability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Monitor our Platform. </strong>&nbsp;Our ad building process is driven by technology. That technology enables us to ensure that major elements of ad units fit seamlessly into their environments. However, when it comes to copy points, our ability to monitor and act on content we deem inappropriate is manual. We do have <a href=\"/creative_ad_policies/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">policies</a> and will remain faithful to them. But our challenge is similar to that facing other major platforms like Facebook (for example) &#8212; applying human oversight to large-scale, technology-built activities requires vigilance. We will be alert during this campaign season and will react proactively and reactively where we see issues arise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Root Out Misinformation Sites. </strong>While tangentially related to political ad spending, TripleLift forged a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cXoM_D1rOpPfMOLg1kfPIcNWPUW3_pnmNnWX0yA060Y/edit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">partnership</a> earlier this year with NewsGuard, the company that fights misinformation by rating and reviewing thousands of news and information websites for credibility and transparency. We have already removed about two dozen sites from our roster that do not meet acceptable levels of credibility. We did this to ensure we do not monetize misinformation or hate speech, which is bad business, inconsistent with our company values, and in conflict with how our advertisers want to spend their dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/political/\">Learn more</a> about how we’re approaching political advertising in this cycle.</p>\n","title":"TripleLift’s Policy on Political Advertising","uri":"/blog/political-advertising-policy/","date":"September 14, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b8f5a207565073729876a13916a8582c/c1257/TL_Vote_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b8f5a207565073729876a13916a8582c/e9e8b/TL_Vote_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.jpg 250w,\n/static/b8f5a207565073729876a13916a8582c/84742/TL_Vote_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.jpg 500w,\n/static/b8f5a207565073729876a13916a8582c/c1257/TL_Vote_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b8f5a207565073729876a13916a8582c/98dbc/TL_Vote_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.avif 250w,\n/static/b8f5a207565073729876a13916a8582c/92e1f/TL_Vote_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.avif 500w,\n/static/b8f5a207565073729876a13916a8582c/658d5/TL_Vote_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/b8f5a207565073729876a13916a8582c/0b151/TL_Vote_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.webp 250w,\n/static/b8f5a207565073729876a13916a8582c/33dd0/TL_Vote_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.webp 500w,\n/static/b8f5a207565073729876a13916a8582c/cd9a3/TL_Vote_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1001}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNjQ5Nw==","excerpt":"<p>Industry veteran joins from OMD to increase product innovation in partnership with agency leaders&nbsp; TripleLift, one of the fastest-growing ad tech companies in the world, announced the hiring of Ben Winkler as Senior Vice President, Agency Strategy.&nbsp; The role was created in response to four years of consecutive growth greater than 70%.

TripleLift’s trajectory is attributed to its omni-channel strategy, which drove a steady increase in new and industry-first advertiser products across desktop, mobile and television. In July, as ad spend continued to scale, the company passed $500m in lifetime publisher payouts. Increasingly, that spend is coming through new revenue channels and being spent on new ad products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winkler brings a powerful combination of expertise in brand strategy, media investment and industry leadership to the role. During his nine years at OMD, Winkler served in C-level roles driving senior relationships inside and outside the company. As Chief Transformation Officer, he created OMDs first-ever programmatic upfront. As Chief Investment Officer, he was responsible for $12B in annual media spend and reorganized the broadcast team into a platform-agnostic video investment group. During that tenure, he led or supported critical client engagements including Hasbro, Cigna, Pepsi, Apple, State Farm, Eli Lilly and CBS. Winkler will partner across TripleLift disciplines to develop the executive level strategy that will lead to deeper, stronger and more solutions oriented relationships with holding companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As TripleLift continues its expansion into display, video and OTT products, the company identified a need to work more closely with agency leaders to innovate within and beyond the current product set. “Ben is a creative problem solver and storyteller who builds and shapes advertising programs with a client-first mindset,” said TripleLift CRO Jax Quantrell. “As we take our business to the next level, it’s valuable for us to add those skills along with his strong track record of digital transformation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After more than 20 years in agencies, Winkler sought new challenges to keep him connected to that part of the industry. “I have a deep understanding of agency and holding company motivations, business drivers and challenges &#8212; many of which can be solved with creative technology. TripleLift has built killer products that are foundationally about transparency and clarity. They don’t just perform, they help close the perceived trust gap in programmatic media. And because programmatic is unquestionably the future, this company and this role are ripe with opportunity.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift co-founder and CEO Eric Berry said the timing was right to make the hire. “We have weathered the storm of the current pandemic and are in a strong market position. The competitive and fast-moving nature of our business means that we must continue to invest in the future. Bringing on a head of agency strategy will enable us to accelerate our roadmap. Ben is an excellent fit for both our culture and ambition.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Winkler starts at TripleLift on September 14th and will report to Quantrell.</p>\n","title":"TripleLift Adds Ben Winkler As First-Ever SVP, Agency Strategy, To Accelerate The Next Phase Of Its Pivot To An Omni-channel Business","uri":"/blog/ben-winkler-joins-triplelift/","date":"September 08, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dbec55e30ad85eb2f077b5799e13b01c/69209/BenWinkler_Headshot_Blog_v2-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/dbec55e30ad85eb2f077b5799e13b01c/e9e8b/BenWinkler_Headshot_Blog_v2-1.jpg 250w,\n/static/dbec55e30ad85eb2f077b5799e13b01c/84742/BenWinkler_Headshot_Blog_v2-1.jpg 500w,\n/static/dbec55e30ad85eb2f077b5799e13b01c/69209/BenWinkler_Headshot_Blog_v2-1.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/dbec55e30ad85eb2f077b5799e13b01c/98dbc/BenWinkler_Headshot_Blog_v2-1.avif 250w,\n/static/dbec55e30ad85eb2f077b5799e13b01c/92e1f/BenWinkler_Headshot_Blog_v2-1.avif 500w,\n/static/dbec55e30ad85eb2f077b5799e13b01c/9b3e4/BenWinkler_Headshot_Blog_v2-1.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/dbec55e30ad85eb2f077b5799e13b01c/0b151/BenWinkler_Headshot_Blog_v2-1.webp 250w,\n/static/dbec55e30ad85eb2f077b5799e13b01c/33dd0/BenWinkler_Headshot_Blog_v2-1.webp 500w,\n/static/dbec55e30ad85eb2f077b5799e13b01c/6429b/BenWinkler_Headshot_Blog_v2-1.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNTc0OQ==","excerpt":"<p>2020 has been a year of disruption.

In fact, many articles have been written searching for “<a href=\"https://www.marketingdive.com/news/15-of-programmatic-ad-spend-disappears-in-the-supply-chain-study-says/577525/\">the lost 15%</a>” of programmatic spend that often seems unaccounted for. We went searching for that delta and revealed compelling insights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At TripleLift, we believe that following the most direct path to an impression yields the greatest benefit to both marketers and publishers. In order to test this theory, we conducted an A/B test to measure performance across different buying channels &#8211; one direct, and one through an intermediary exchange &#8211; to demonstrate the quantitative impact of removing intermediaries from the supply chain.<br><br><strong>The Test</strong><br>This analysis evaluated the same campaigns, launched by the same brands, bidding on the same publisher inventory, with the same bidding strategies, on the same DSP. The only difference between path A vs. B was the inclusion of an intermediary exchange, adding a hop to the transaction, and taking a nominal fee (5-10%). In this case, the intermediary exchange was reselling the same publisher inventory available in the original exchange. Our test looked at over $680,000 in live media spend, representing 385M impressions that ran over a 30-day time period.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Executive Summary</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buying inventory directly &#8211; with no intermediary exchanges or resellers &#8211; improves your campaign performance, auction performance, and bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Results<br></strong>The test yielded significant differences in performance across path A vs. B, and a variety of key programmatic metrics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Win rates</strong> are <strong>3.8x higher</strong> when buying directly (vs. through an intermediary exchange). In a competitive ecosystem dominated by header bidding, downstream win rate is directly linked to improving a marketer’s access to premium inventory and ability to deliver a campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>CPMs</strong>: Clearing CPMs are <strong>28% lower</strong> when buying directly. Removing a financial intermediary from the transaction allows lower bids to win more often in auction.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>CPC</strong>: Cost-per-click (CPC) is <strong>220% lower </strong>when buying directly. This metric is a direct function of media cost, which was lower on average via the direct path.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Auction performance</strong>: Bids beat competitor’s bids <strong>40% more often </strong>when buying directly. Outbidding competitive bids from other DSPs improves a marketer’s access to the most highly coveted inventory and users.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What It Means for Buyers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, being an effective buyer of media means two things: having transparency into the inventory and maximizing performance. Checking sellers.json and ads.txt files helps with the former and this test shows that performance is optimized through the most direct paths to inventory. Taking a sample $100k media budget, buying programmatic media directly &#8211; without the presence of resellers &#8211; directly delivers <strong>14m more impressions</strong> on <strong>2.2b fewer bids</strong>, leading to more clicks and other performance KPIs.<br><br>For more information on directness and this study in particular, reach out to us….<a href=\"/contact-us/?utm_source=int&amp;utm_medium=blg&amp;utm_campaign=direct-cs&amp;utm_content=lp\">directly</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"has-text-align-center\"><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TL_CaseStudy_Directness_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Download the case study results.</a></h6>\n","title":"Directness Test Reveals the Perils of Resold Impressions","uri":"/blog/directness-test-reveals-perils-resold-inventory/","date":"August 19, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTo0MjE=","name":"Directness"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1d0accaeab338dc24127c31b2f9ac05d/69209/TL_Directness_CS_blog_1024x1024-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1d0accaeab338dc24127c31b2f9ac05d/e9e8b/TL_Directness_CS_blog_1024x1024-1.jpg 250w,\n/static/1d0accaeab338dc24127c31b2f9ac05d/84742/TL_Directness_CS_blog_1024x1024-1.jpg 500w,\n/static/1d0accaeab338dc24127c31b2f9ac05d/69209/TL_Directness_CS_blog_1024x1024-1.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1d0accaeab338dc24127c31b2f9ac05d/98dbc/TL_Directness_CS_blog_1024x1024-1.avif 250w,\n/static/1d0accaeab338dc24127c31b2f9ac05d/92e1f/TL_Directness_CS_blog_1024x1024-1.avif 500w,\n/static/1d0accaeab338dc24127c31b2f9ac05d/9b3e4/TL_Directness_CS_blog_1024x1024-1.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/1d0accaeab338dc24127c31b2f9ac05d/0b151/TL_Directness_CS_blog_1024x1024-1.webp 250w,\n/static/1d0accaeab338dc24127c31b2f9ac05d/33dd0/TL_Directness_CS_blog_1024x1024-1.webp 500w,\n/static/1d0accaeab338dc24127c31b2f9ac05d/6429b/TL_Directness_CS_blog_1024x1024-1.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNjQ5NQ==","excerpt":"<p>As the old expression goes: ‘ad tech giveth and ad tech taketh away.’ Ok&#8230;that might not be an actual expression, but we all know it’s true.

Every month we’ll share an interview with one of our premium publishers, highlighting unique stories and uncovering valuable insights. This week we’re speaking with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/shobha-vembar-doshi-b1b3077/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Shobha Doshi, VP, Programmatic Strategy &amp; Operations at CafeMedia</strong>.</a> Read on to learn about how Shobha became an important piece of the CafeMedia puzzle and her advice on maximizing your potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thanks for joining us Shobha! To kick things off, can you tell us about your early career? What do you think was key to getting your foot in the door?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My very first job out of college, where I studied marketing and psychology, was on the Marketing team at Novartis Pharmaceuticals. Right after that came my first foray into the digital advertising world as a Media Planner at The New York Times. At that point, I took a break from working to get my MBA. Having some real-world business experience really helped me to apply a lot of what I was learning in the graduate program and set the path for my next step. Once I graduated, I joined up with CafeMedia (then CafeMom!). I’ve been at CafeMedia for almost nine years, which is a lifetime in our industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When did you know that Programmatic advertising was an area you wanted to focus on?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve always been interested in marketing in some form or another, but originally fell into digital by chance at NYT. When I continued to pursue it at CafeMedia, there were a small handful of us who kicked off programmatic advertising as a kind of second job. And it took off like wildfire. I find it such an interesting space because it’s always evolving. You can count on coming across something new frequently and that has continued to challenge and educate me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What intrigued you the most about CafeMedia and what keeps you engaged?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After working at two large companies, I wanted to get the experience of a smaller company. Everyone I met there was smart and savvy, and it felt like a scrappy company where I could learn so much and grow as they grew. And that’s exactly what’s happened — I went from being a Sales Development Manager to helping build the Programmatic team from the ground up. Our goal is to help our publishers do what they love best and excel at, which is creating amazing content for their users and not having to worry about managing their ad revenue. CafeMedia is a leader in the programmatic ecosystem, and I want to make sure we continue to push forward and innovate with our partners alongside us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What advice would you give to women who are interested in a career in ad tech?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with many industries, women are underrepresented in ad tech, and that’s even more true for women of color. I would encourage women to fight for themselves — speak up, ask for what you deserve, and keep on pushing until you get it. It has been and will be a long road, but we are our own best advocates and can continue to set a good example for the next generation of women coming into the workforce. I would also add that for those who have already found some success, we should take up the responsibility to pay it forward and help up-and-coming women to succeed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What tips do you have for achieving the ever elusive work/life balance?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>First of all, acknowledge that it’s hard. You don’t have to “have it all” — you have to do what works for you and your situation. There may be weeks that are more work, but make sure that there are weeks that are more life and family too. Get help, in whatever form that takes, and don’t be afraid to ask for it. Find a company that cares about YOU and will help with creating that balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How have you been handling the Covid-19 pandemic from a work perspective?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our HQ is in New York City so, similar to many other businesses there, the office has been closed since March. The majority of us were actually remote before the pandemic, so we were in a good spot to make the virtual transition relatively smoothly. We had already heavily embraced Zoom, but now we’ve added in virtual happy hours and more frequent check-ins. I’ve been encouraging my team to remember to take time off, even if it’s to do nothing, since it’s been easier than ever to forget that everyone still needs recharge and reset time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From a publisher perspective, what are the challenges that programmatic is facing right now that keep you up at night?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to a lot of others in the industry, I’m constantly thinking about identity, privacy, and third-party cookies going away. We’ve been planning for this for a long time and are always testing solutions and partnerships that will help to mitigate a lot of these issues. We’ve also leaned into context and our advertiser partnerships in a big way. CafeMedia has been very vocal in the industry to make sure that independent publishers have a strong advocate and are encouraging other partners and publishers to do the same. It will be a landmark time for our industry, and I think we’ll come out of it with some really innovative and groundbreaking ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is one lesson you wish you had learned earlier in your career?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imposter syndrome is real, most commonly for women — I wish I had realized earlier what I was feeling and how to address it. I believe it held me back from pushing forward in certain situations and points in my career, though I was fully capable. It has been a process to fight it, and it still rears its head sometimes, but I continue to remind myself and encourage other women to be aware, be confident, and know yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When you’re not making things happen at CafeMedia, what do you like to do for fun?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Spend time with my two boys and husband — we’ve had to be more creative these days to find activities to keep us busy and get out of the house safely, so we end up in our backyard a lot running around. I also love to read, so whenever I can, I’ll have my nose in a book. Pre-COVID, I really enjoyed traveling and hope we can get back to a new normal where that’s possible again. In the meantime, I’ve been exploring local hiking spots to get outdoors for a change of scenery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>For more information about TripleLift, our publishers, or how to be featured in a publisher spotlight, please&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\">contact us here</a>.</em></strong></p>\n","title":"Success Stories From Women at the Top: CafeMedia’s Shobha Doshi","uri":"/blog/success-stories-women-cafemedia/","date":"August 11, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo4OA==","name":"publishers"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7cc648ced47bdb0bb420319ef3814eea/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_CafeMedia_Blog-1.png","srcSet":"/static/7cc648ced47bdb0bb420319ef3814eea/5add7/TL_PubSpotlight_CafeMedia_Blog-1.png 250w,\n/static/7cc648ced47bdb0bb420319ef3814eea/aef42/TL_PubSpotlight_CafeMedia_Blog-1.png 500w,\n/static/7cc648ced47bdb0bb420319ef3814eea/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_CafeMedia_Blog-1.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7cc648ced47bdb0bb420319ef3814eea/98dbc/TL_PubSpotlight_CafeMedia_Blog-1.avif 250w,\n/static/7cc648ced47bdb0bb420319ef3814eea/92e1f/TL_PubSpotlight_CafeMedia_Blog-1.avif 500w,\n/static/7cc648ced47bdb0bb420319ef3814eea/9b3e4/TL_PubSpotlight_CafeMedia_Blog-1.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/7cc648ced47bdb0bb420319ef3814eea/0b151/TL_PubSpotlight_CafeMedia_Blog-1.webp 250w,\n/static/7cc648ced47bdb0bb420319ef3814eea/33dd0/TL_PubSpotlight_CafeMedia_Blog-1.webp 500w,\n/static/7cc648ced47bdb0bb420319ef3814eea/6429b/TL_PubSpotlight_CafeMedia_Blog-1.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"offset":18,"postsPerPage":9,"nextPagePath":"/blog/4","previousPagePath":"/blog/2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
