Due to reselling, a single impression goes through an average of 15 auctions, which creates a condition where buyers bid against themselves. Resellers also come with additional fees, but often there&#8217;s not a clear understanding of the value they provide.</p>\n<p>The key to simplifying this? Supply Path Optimization (SPO). Lehman reveals how SPO will be essential for creating meaningful changes to how supply is managed, considered, and decisioned — and why impulsively cutting won’t be the answer.</p>\n<p>Watch the full video now.</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"SPO Will Be The Best Development In Programmatic\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5N_r9AovHY?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<h5>Ready to start your SPO strategy?
