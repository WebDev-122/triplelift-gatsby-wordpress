Native Video solves these challenges by combining the highest performing types of digital advertising (social, video and native) and makes it easy to scale across premium content sites. Native video enables advertisers to take advantage of the engaging nature of video and high visibility associated with Native placements.</p>\n<p>The success of Native Video is due in part to the benefits that this format provides in market:</p>\n<p><strong>Awareness and Recall:</strong> The most advantageous is its ability to drive brand awareness and recognition. Native Video provides advertisers with a rich, engaging canvas for displaying a brands’ message and when combined with a headline and logo further drives that brand recall.</p>\n<p><strong>Respectful:</strong> Facebook really paved the way for other players in the ad-tech space to explore sound off, instant play video. By carving this path, they have opened up an opportunity for other players to compete in this space. It not only creates a new set of inventory for publishers but provides consumers with a non-interruptive, unintrusive experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Scale:</strong> TripleLift has more than 1 billion video impressions available daily, allowing you to execute your video campaigns across the world’s most premium publishers.</p>\n<p><strong>Easy to Execute:</strong> Leverage the same assets you use for social video across the web, in TripleLift’s easy to execute workflow.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TripleLift has built out three different video formats to help our customers run their video campaigns at scale and reach their consumers in the most engaging, respectful and effective ways possible.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marketing.triplelift.com/acton/attachment/22206/f-0647/0/-/-/-/-/TripleLift%20Video%20CTP%20Sheet.pdf\"><strong>Click-to-Play Video</strong></a>: Branding elements of in-feed native with the added capability of video</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marketing.triplelift.com/acton/attachment/22206/f-0648/0/-/-/-/-/TripleLift%20Instant%20Play%20Sheet.pdf\"><strong>Instant Play Video</strong></a>: Eye-catching sight, sound, and motion delivered in the feed of content once in-view</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://marketing.triplelift.com/acton/attachment/22206/f-0649/0/-/-/-/-/TripleLift%20Outstream%20Sheet.pdf\"><strong>Outstream Video</strong></a>: Leverage existing video assets to scale campaigns and gain access to a unique set of TripleLift in-feed inventory\t\t</p>\n","title":"Sight, Sound, and Motion: TripleLift’s Native In-Feed Video","uri":"/blog/sight-sound-and-motion-triplelifts-native-in-feed-video/","date":"June 20, 2018","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNjc=","name":"Click-to-Play"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNjg=","name":"In-Feed Video"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNjk=","name":"Instant Play"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OA==","name":"Native advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNDU=","name":"Native video"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNzA=","name":"Native Video Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNzE=","name":"Outstream"}]},"featuredImage":null,"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/privacy-please-protecting-user-data-and-privacy-across-the-internet/","title":"Privacy Please!
