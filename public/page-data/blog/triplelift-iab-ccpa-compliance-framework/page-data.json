The full impact is yet to be seen, as much of the legislation is still being finalized and enforcement of CCPA is not expected until July 2020. But with fines to businesses ranging from $2,500 to $7,500 per violation, it’s important for companies to understand how to be in compliance.</p>\n<h5>How TripleLift is taking action.</h5>\n<p>As of January 1, 2020, TripleLift is a signatory to the <a href=\"https://www.iab.com/guidelines/ccpa-framework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IAB CCPA Compliance Framework</a>. Our adoption of the IAB framework aligns with our core mission of creating user-centric advertising that <i>earns </i>consumer attention.</p>\n<p>How will TripleLift adopt the IAB framework?</p>\n<p>TripleLift will send the <a href=\"https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/U.S.-Privacy-String-v1.0-IAB-Tech-Lab.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">us_privacy string</a> via the <a href=\"https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/OpenRTB-Extension-U.S.-Privacy-IAB-Tech-Lab.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">OpenRTB Privacy Extension</a> to participating DSPs.</p>\n<h5>How to Adopt the IAB CCPA Framework</h5>\n<p>TripleLift urges publishers and DSP partners to become members of the IAB CCPA Framework to support each party’s efforts towards compliance with the CCPA.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Participating publishers that sell information from California consumers for the purposes of digital advertising must <a href=\"https://www.iab.com/guidelines/ccpa-framework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">comply with the guidelines as applicable</a> and should send California traffic to TripleLift and downstream participants in compliance with CCPA. As publishers have the only direct relationships with users of their digital properties, it is the responsibility of publishers to provide the CCPA required Do Not Sell My Personal Information links and CCPA disclosures to users of publishers’ properties and to send TripleLift the us_privacy signal when a user opts-out of the “sale” of their data. If TripleLift does not receive the us_privacy signal from a publisher partner, we will treat these bid requests from publishers as having not opted out of a “sale” under CCPA.</li>\n<li>TripleLift will consider the user sync as a &#8220;sale&#8221; of data and therefore will adhere to IAB CCPA Framework guidelines.</li>\n<li>We expect continued adoption from publishers and DSP partners by the enforcement date of July 1, 2020. If your DSP is a signatory to the IAB CCPA Framework, it will be important to consider how you will respond in the event of no signal.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Download Your FAQ Sheet</h5>\n<p>Learn more about how to adopt the IAB Compliance Framework for the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<h6><a href=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CCPA_FAQs-DSP.pdf?utm_source=int&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=ccpa&amp;utm_content=faqs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>DSPs</strong></a></h6>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h6><a href=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CCPA_FAQs-Publisher.pdf?utm_source=int&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=ccpa&amp;utm_content=faqs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Publishers</strong></a></h6>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h6><a href=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/CCPA_FAQ_Agency.pdf?utm_source=int&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=ccpa&amp;utm_content=faqs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><strong>Brands &amp; Agencies</strong></a></h6>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Have questions? </b>Reach out to <a href=\"mailto:privacy@triplelift.com\">privacy@triplelift.com</a><b>.</b></p>\n","title":"California Consumer Privacy Act: How TripleLift Is Adopting the IAB CCPA Compliance Framework","uri":"/blog/triplelift-iab-ccpa-compliance-framework/","date":"December 31, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTozOTE=","name":"California Consumer Privacy Act"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTozOTI=","name":"CCPA"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTozOTM=","name":"IAB CCPA Compliance Framework"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/935665f3c23bac0d256cdf4e2b6265c1/69209/CCPA2020-Blog-1500x1500-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/935665f3c23bac0d256cdf4e2b6265c1/e9e8b/CCPA2020-Blog-1500x1500-1.jpg 250w,\n/static/935665f3c23bac0d256cdf4e2b6265c1/84742/CCPA2020-Blog-1500x1500-1.jpg 500w,\n/static/935665f3c23bac0d256cdf4e2b6265c1/69209/CCPA2020-Blog-1500x1500-1.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/935665f3c23bac0d256cdf4e2b6265c1/98dbc/CCPA2020-Blog-1500x1500-1.avif 250w,\n/static/935665f3c23bac0d256cdf4e2b6265c1/92e1f/CCPA2020-Blog-1500x1500-1.avif 500w,\n/static/935665f3c23bac0d256cdf4e2b6265c1/9b3e4/CCPA2020-Blog-1500x1500-1.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/935665f3c23bac0d256cdf4e2b6265c1/0b151/CCPA2020-Blog-1500x1500-1.webp 250w,\n/static/935665f3c23bac0d256cdf4e2b6265c1/33dd0/CCPA2020-Blog-1500x1500-1.webp 500w,\n/static/935665f3c23bac0d256cdf4e2b6265c1/6429b/CCPA2020-Blog-1500x1500-1.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/how-ott-services-are-looking-to-further-capitalize-on-product-placement/","title":"How OTT Services Are Looking to Further Capitalize on Product Placement"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/top-advertising-moments-2010s-predictions-2020/","title":"The Hottest Advertising Trends from the Last Decade & Top Predictions for the 2020s"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyMzg1MA==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDAwNQ==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyMzc3Ng=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
