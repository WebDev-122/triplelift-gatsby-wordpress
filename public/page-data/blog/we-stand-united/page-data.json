Simple as that. At TripleLift, our approach to diversity, equity and inclusion focuses on supporting our employees unequivocally and taking an actionable stand in the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is clear that the recent murders of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd and countless others represent only a fraction of the scope of cruelty taking place in America today. And, of course, this is just a glimpse into the struggles of Black Americans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are committed to building a company that is inclusive and avowedly anti-racist. We may all be experiencing this differently, but we are all in this together.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift has work to do and there are actions that we will take now and over time &#8212; to ensure both sustained effort and impact within our company and across our industry. Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion will be raised up and more formally institutionalized within our efforts as a company &#8212; which we believe will contribute to a more just society. We are choosing this moment as an opportunity to move our small community forward in the interest of collective good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example of that good, TripleLift is supporting the <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/?_ga=2.105645827.1281365163.1591656000-1347297847.1591382301&amp;_gac=1.52752028.1591656001.EAIaIQobChMI_8L60KTz6QIVNB-tBh04HgjOEAAYASAAEgJ5fPD_BwE\">NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund</a>, America’s premier legal organization fighting for racial justice. Through litigation, advocacy, and public education, LDF seeks structural changes to expand democracy, eliminate disparities, and achieve racial justice in a society that fulfills the promise of equality for all Americans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every virtual meeting we hold during the month of June will unlock $5 to support this essential service working tirelessly to bring about systemic change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it makes sense to <a href=\"/contact-us/?utm_source=int&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=meals&amp;utm_content=lp\">join us for a meeting</a> to help address your digital media plans, let’s hop on a video chat.
