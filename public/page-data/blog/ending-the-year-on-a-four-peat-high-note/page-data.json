For four consecutive years, we have earned the right to appear on three important lists: The <em>Inc. 5000</em>, <em>Deloitte Fast 500</em> and <em>Crain’s Fast 50</em>. To appear on each list, companies need to demonstrate high rates of growth. And TripleLift has been bringing the goods for four straight years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Inc 5000 ranks companies across industries by revenue growth over a three-year period. In that span, TripleLift ranked #1,402. The Deloitte Fast 500 measures the fastest growing technology companies in North America and we came in at #202 on their list. Crain’s placed us at #24 on their list of fastest growing New York-based companies alongside impressive peers such as Lemonade, Peloton, Noom, Compass, WeWork and Brooklinen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part is that our metrics continue heading up. None of these surveys takes into account the full calendar year 2020, where our exponential growth has continued. So when we submit again next year we should have a good chance of making it five-for-five. We already know that 2020 will be our 9th consecutive year of high double digit (or more) revenue growth, and our 5th year in a row of accelerating profitability. Meaning: we are doing better year-over-year in our bottomline, even as we are getting larger in our topline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You routinely hear me talk about the balance of the human and math sides of our business. We focus attention and resources on our people to unlock success that materializes in our numbers. So, while we routinely celebrate our human accomplishments, it’s incredibly gratifying to receive acknowledgement for the results themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exceptional growth, driven by exceptional people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congratulations to the whole team on these great distinctions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric</p>\n","title":"Ending the Year on a “Four-Peat” High Note","uri":"/blog/ending-the-year-on-a-four-peat-high-note/","date":"December 03, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/69209/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/e9e8b/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.jpg 250w,\n/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/84742/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.jpg 500w,\n/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/69209/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/98dbc/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.avif 250w,\n/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/92e1f/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.avif 500w,\n/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/9b3e4/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/0b151/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.webp 250w,\n/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/33dd0/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.webp 500w,\n/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/6429b/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/demystifying-the-value-of-ott-brand-integrations/","title":"Demystifying the Value of Brand Integrations"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/navigating-evolving-dsp-dynamics-with-mediavine/","title":"Navigating Evolving DSP Dynamics with Mediavine"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyODAwNA==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyODA1MQ==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNzAzNA=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
