TripleLift’s <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/maxdowaliby/\">Max Dowaliby</a>, Senior Director of Product, joined us to offer a deeper look at how TripleLift is helping buyers and publishers to protect their brand, budget and business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>There’s been a good deal of discussion about programmatic ad fraud lately, but you’ve said that fraud is part of a larger set of problems that TripleLift is solving.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s right. We think about ad quality from a number of angles, and fraud is obviously a very important part of that. But so is understanding where ad dollars are going, knowing that the publishers that you’re working with are legitimate, and making sure the ad is viewable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let’s touch on all those issues, but starting with fraud specifically.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When people say “ad fraud,” they generally mean invalid traffic from bots. It’s really important to an advertiser that their ads are in front of human eyes. With human eyes, you get actions, like clicks for purchases, or signing up for an account. If those ads are being shown to fake people, there’s zero chance that those fake people can take the action the advertiser wants.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What steps has TripleLift taken to combat invalid traffic?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to ensure that our buyers and our partners never have the opportunity to buy a single impression that can be identified as fraud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve built a deep relationship with WhiteOps. We were one of their first supply side partners. Every ad is pre-scanned by WhiteOps for fraud before brands have an opportunity to bid on it. If WhiteOps tells us that they believe that an ad opportunity stems from a bad actor, we don&#8217;t hold an auction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you deal with publishers that might feature hate speech? That’s a huge concern for advertisers.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve taken a hard stance that we won’t monetize content that is identified as misinformation or malicious content. Last year we began partnering with NewsGuard, an organization that uses trained journalists to rate the quality of news and information sites, all by hand. Their trust ratings help us to monitor publishers for misinformation, hate speech and calls to violence. Anytime a publisher appears on their list, if we work with that publisher, we drop them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Can you give a sense of how many sites you had to drop?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After we measured our impression volumes, it turned out that we never had a significant problem to begin with. We started to think, why was that the case? It boils down to the fact that we have direct relationships with all of our publishers. We can pick up the phone and call every single one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So those direct relationships are very helpful from a buyer perspective.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our direct relationships with publishers are important to advertisers in two ways. The first is an efficiency gain &#8212; you’re not paying a margin twice or even three times in some cases. The second is that you avoid uncertainty of the ad experience. Without directness, you don’t know where some piece of inventory originates, which can introduce brand safety and some of the other issues we’re discussing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Since we’re talking about buyer concerns, let’s touch on how TripleLift deals with viewability.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We work with all of the industry leading partners here. MOAT is a huge partner of ours. We are compatible with every viewability vendor and ensure that none of the inventory on our platform falls below a certain threshold. We don&#8217;t want to hold auctions for inventory that have a very low likelihood of ever being viewed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We’ve touched on social responsibility and the ad ecosystem. Is there anything you want to add about that?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The programmatic ecosystem in general has a responsibility to understand that it directs a lot of money, and where these ad dollars go has a dramatic impact on a lot of things. It’s unfortunate that sometimes only the brand gets blowback for where their ads end up, but not those who are monetizing the malicious content &#8211; there are multiple parties here (ourselves included) who should be held responsible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At TripleLift, we want to make sure we are not funding entities that promote misinformation, hate speech, or calls to violence. We also want to protect our brand partners; no brand wants to see their ad next to hate speech.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But with the policies we’ve discussed at TripleLift, just choosing the right SSP can solve so many issues for brands.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brands should know what inventory they&#8217;re buying, and some inventory just shouldn&#8217;t be available for purchase. If you think about it, spending on malicious sites takes dollars away from genuinely good content on the internet. That’s part of why TripleLift has created initiatives to direct advertising dollars to good causes. For example, through our Exchange Traded Deals, curated inventory packages, buyers can help to advance equality by directing spend to minority-owned publishers. There is social capital in this, but there is also real money flowing between the advertisers and these publishers. And that good outcome happens because of programmatic advertising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thanks so much, Max!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"/go/we-go-beyond/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">See more on how TripleLift goes beyond to deliver scale, quality and service to ensure your campaign&#8217;s success.</a></h5>\n","title":"The Real Cost of Fraud and Low Quality Environments","uri":"/blog/the-real-cost-of-fraud-and-low-quality-environments/","date":"February 24, 2021","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9e171a6d5f48fa25586f610ed59ff470/8f3c3/WGB-realcostodfraud-uberblog.png","srcSet":"/static/9e171a6d5f48fa25586f610ed59ff470/5add7/WGB-realcostodfraud-uberblog.png 250w,\n/static/9e171a6d5f48fa25586f610ed59ff470/aef42/WGB-realcostodfraud-uberblog.png 500w,\n/static/9e171a6d5f48fa25586f610ed59ff470/8f3c3/WGB-realcostodfraud-uberblog.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/9e171a6d5f48fa25586f610ed59ff470/98dbc/WGB-realcostodfraud-uberblog.avif 250w,\n/static/9e171a6d5f48fa25586f610ed59ff470/92e1f/WGB-realcostodfraud-uberblog.avif 500w,\n/static/9e171a6d5f48fa25586f610ed59ff470/9b3e4/WGB-realcostodfraud-uberblog.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/9e171a6d5f48fa25586f610ed59ff470/0b151/WGB-realcostodfraud-uberblog.webp 250w,\n/static/9e171a6d5f48fa25586f610ed59ff470/33dd0/WGB-realcostodfraud-uberblog.webp 500w,\n/static/9e171a6d5f48fa25586f610ed59ff470/6429b/WGB-realcostodfraud-uberblog.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDozMDU4Ng==","excerpt":"<p>True to form for 2020, the end of the year brought about one last piece of bad news: in December, the US saw a net loss of 140,000 jobs.&nbsp; And if that wasn’t upsetting enough, the research further revealed that women actually lost 156,000 jobs while men gained 16,000 &#8211; meaning 100% of the net [&hellip;]</p>\n","content":"\n<p>True to form for 2020, the end of the year brought about one last piece of bad news: in December, the US saw a <a href=\"https://www.ellevest.com/magazine/disrupt-money/jobs-lost-women-of-color?ko_click_id=ko_vxti7c26p7ap9dqdw&amp;utm_source=IG&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=wte-newsletter&amp;utm_content=jobs-lost-woc&amp;live_date=20210112&amp;placement=post\">net loss</a> of 140,000 jobs.&nbsp; And if that wasn’t upsetting enough, the research further revealed that women actually lost <em>156,000 </em>jobs while men gained <em>16,000</em> &#8211; meaning 100% of the net job losses belonged to women.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A Stalled Workforce</strong>&nbsp;<br>Before the pandemic, women were making huge strides in entering the workforce; once COVID hit, many women’s careers took a backseat, to take care of their families, or by job losses. Crain’s Detroit further dives into these losses:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The share of women between the ages of 25 and 54, so-called prime-age workers and those most likely to have young children at home, who were either employed or looking for a job, dropped to 73.5 percent in April from 76.9 percent before the pandemic (<a href=\"https://www.crainsdetroit.com/economy/us-women-workers-color-bear-brunt-december-job-losses\">Source</a>).</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/5900583/women-workforce-economy-covid/\">Many women have made the decision to leave the workforce</a>, in order to balance their family lives with the demands of parenting through a global pandemic, when many children are being schooled online at home. The fact that this workforce exodus is happening with less frequency for men indicates we still have a long way to go in closing the wage gap and in ensuring the brunt of caregiving does not fall solely on women.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Employment Gaps at the Intersection of Race and Gender</strong>&nbsp;<br>It gets worse:: <a href=\"https://www.ellevest.com/magazine/disrupt-money/jobs-lost-women-of-color?ko_click_id=ko_vxti7c26p7ap9dqdw&amp;utm_source=IG&amp;utm_medium=organic-social&amp;utm_campaign=wte-newsletter&amp;utm_content=jobs-lost-woc&amp;live_date=20210112&amp;placement=post\">Black and Latinx women were hit the hardest by these job losses</a>. The effect this will have on BIPOC families could be devastating.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2020/04/23/483846/frontlines-work-home/\">The Center for American Progress</a> reports that “67.5 percent of Black mothers and 41.4 percent of Latina mothers were the primary or sole breadwinners for their families, compared with 37 percent of white mothers.”&nbsp; Not to mention, the intersection of race and gender creates cumulative barriers that women of color must face when job-seeking, from wage gaps to outright discrimination when interviewing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>The Women’s Initiative Network (WIN) is Angry— Rightfully</strong><br>As <a href=\"https://time.com/5929800/melinda-gates-womens-voices-rebuilding-covid-19/\">Melinda Gates writes in <em>Time</em></a>, “COVID-19 has helped us see the failures of our social contract with new clarity, and all around the world, people are refusing to look away.” In fact, she goes on to write, in one survey nine out of ten people were hoping for a more “sustainable and equitable” world after we come out the other side of this pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here at TripleLift the Women’s Initiative Network (WIN) is an employee resource group whose mission is to uplift and advocate for all women at TripleLift and in the broader community. We, too, want to see a more sustainable and equitable world, and we don’t want to wait to do it. As women who are privileged to have jobs during a time when people are facing terrible losses— and when women, especially women of color, are facing disproportionate losses— we wanted to turn our anger into action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Every Meeting Will Make a Difference For These Women</strong><br>This is why TripleLift is bringing back our <em>Every Meeting Makes a Difference</em> initiative.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift started <a href=\"/blog/every-meeting-makes-a-difference/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Every Meeting Makes a Difference</a> at the beginning of the pandemic to provide meals to frontline and clinic workers through World Central Kitchen. We saw enormous success with our partners who participated in meetings in an effort to drive meals for those who needed it most. This time, we are looking to support nonprofits focused on women’s employment in an effort to ensure the US does not repeat another December 2020 job report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, for every meeting that clients take with TripleLifters we will donate to three charities to support women in and out of the workplace:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://dressforsuccess.org/\">Dress for Success Worldwide</a>: a global nonprofit that empowers women to achieve economic independence by providing a network of support, professional attire and the development tools to help women thrive in work and in life.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.globalfundforwomen.org/\">Global Fund for Women</a>: uses powerful networks to find, fund, and amplify the courageous work of women who are building social movements and challenging the status quo.

Every month we’ll share an interview with one of our premium publishers, highlighting unique stories and uncovering valuable insights. This month, we’re speaking with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-youn-47a1b633/\">Samuel Youn, Director of Programmatic Revenue Strategy at Chegg</a>. Read on to learn about Chegg’s yield optimization efforts and the changes they’ve seen in remote learning over the past 10 months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thank you for speaking with us Samuel! Can you start by telling us a bit about yourself and your role at Chegg? </strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Director of Programmatic Strategy, my goal is to grow programmatic revenue on all of Chegg’s surfaces to subsidize or even completely offset the cost of our services for students. I started my programmatic advertising career in 2013 at a company that was later acquired by Chegg in 2016.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chegg owns and operates several websites that reach over 30 million students per year, and is the leading direct-to-student learning platform today. We strive to improve educational outcomes by putting the student first in all our decisions. In short, we support students on their journey from high school to college and into their career with tools designed to help them pass their tests, pass their classes and save money on required materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What drew you to programmatic strategy? How have you seen that strategy evolve since you began working in programmatic?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like most people in Programmatic Advertising, I didn’t intend to build my career in this space, but I fell into it fortuitously. What drew me into strategy was the quick moving nature of the industry, data-driven results and the open-ended opportunities for improvement. It’s an amazing career that marries creativity, data and technology &#8212; best of all, it is measured by revenue! Being able to tie revenue to our student mission has made my career even more rewarding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As programmatic technology has evolved, it has opened the door to better processes built around technology and data. The watershed moment in my career thus far was the emergence of header bidding. This fundamentally changed how we operated; for the first time, data was democratized for publishers, allowing us insight and most of all, control over how auctions were mediated. As a result, our processes and organization changed to emphasize engineering, AB testing and data analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Speaking of evolutions, obviously much has changed recently in the way that students are learning. How has your business changed since the start of the pandemic?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chegg has always believed that the modern student would need greater support through online services that were accessible and affordable. Even before the pandemic, Chegg was focused on the inevitable transition of education going digital; the pandemic certainly accelerated this transition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fortunately, our business didn’t need to change, but we had to ramp up our systems to support the massive growth as students transitioned to remote learning. We experienced 82% YoY growth in content views and our paying subscribers grew by 69% YoY in Q3 (per our Q3 earnings report).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a programmatic lens, we took the down-market effects of the pandemic and used it as an opportunity to reset our yield strategy. Maximizing yield is our constant goal; we pivoted our strategy to focus on tech-driven yield optimizations as we know that these changes could improve yield even in a down market. Even though CPMs may have decreased at a macro level from economic trends, our ability to maximize auctions through mediation and viewability optimizations has shown lift in our AB tests.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also emphasized strategies that were most sustainable and forward thinking. To do that, we examined our setup closely, and created a strategy around the quality of our ad placements and demand path. Our focus became creating the most attractive inventory for buyers and providing the most efficient paths to advertising budgets. We recognized that these two approaches could make an immediate impact, but also would set us up for success once the market recovered.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Would love to learn more about your yield optimization efforts. What metrics do you look at as measurements of success? What are some tools that you use to increase viewability?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our goal is to make our inventory valuable and efficient for buyers. Viewability is our best indicator for value, as we’ve been able to measure that each decile increase in viewability correlates to an increase in CPM. To improve viewability, we’ve made shared goals between Product and Ads to ensure that we are moving towards product design that keeps viewability a priority.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Efficiency is important for Supply Path Optimization as well as Demand Path Optimization. To measure efficiency, we first assess how much revenue an SSP is contributing to our stack. If the percentage of revenue is low from a specific SSP, we may consider removing them to eliminate low performing paths to our supply, and for our own operational efficiency internally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, an even more telling metric is valueAdd. ValueAdd is a metric that we created to describe the difference between the winning bid for any specific partner and the second highest bid. To do this, we capture log level data which includes every bid response from each of our header partners, regardless if they win or lose the auction. This metric tells us the margin at which each SSP wins an auction by (incremental lift).&nbsp; If we find that a partner has a very low percentage of total revenue contribution to our stack, but that has very high valueAdd, we may consider keeping them in our stack. Why? Though they win auctions infrequently, they win auctions at very large margins which equates to significant incremental revenue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What trends in the digital learning space have surprised you the most over the past ten months?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already anticipated that our users would depend on us more during the pandemic, but we were really excited and surprised at how fast new students engaged with us internationally. The pandemic is truly a global challenge and it is impacting schools around the world. We’re really happy that so many students are finding us for support during these challenging times.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any predictions for what the next year will look like for digital learning?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I’ve learned anything this year, it is to be wary of predictions. That said, a silver lining from this pandemic has been that many students and teachers have been forced to test the limits of what is possible with remote learning, and have learned that a lot can be accomplished online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our recent studies have shown that two out of three US undergraduates would welcome more online learning after the pandemic ends. Professors have also warmed to the idea of online teaching, as now roughly one of two professors feel that online education is an effective teaching method. Our surveys also showed that teachers and professors feel better prepared to teach online, improving by 38% since May.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are some of the advantages of working with Chegg right now that advertisers should know about?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe Chegg has more direct-to-student relationships than any other institution<em>. </em>Advertisers have a brand-safe opportunity to be an integrated and visible partner in our student mission in helping increasing access to modernized learning experiences at a low cost<em>. </em>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have several branded opportunities that integrate directly into the student experience, all of which can be transacted programmatically<em>. </em>The best example of this is our custom Hero unit, which functions as a rewarded video ad unit that unlocks paid features for students free of charge. This unit requires engagement from the user and is a full-page experience that supports both display and click-to-play unmuted video.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that we provide unique &amp; compelling services, our students are willing to engage with our advertisements. We have multiple surfaces under the Chegg brand which facilitate different student needs, and we’d love to build partnerships with brands to build unique integrations through all aspects of the student journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Last question!

We certainly didn’t draw it up that way but, collectively, we really made it work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a company that sits at the middle of a vibrant ecosystem, we know that we only win when everyone wins &#8212; our customers, our partners and our employees. If one is out of kilter, our business can become off balance. When Covid hit, we knew immediately that our success was going to be determined by the support we gave, as well as the support we got in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In early April, we planted the green shoots of our recovery by focusing on this very notion &#8211; supportiveness &#8211; in three different ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Supporting our customers and partners</strong></li><li><strong>Supporting society</strong></li><li><strong>Supporting our employees</strong></li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>This Lift Letter is about how we made the idea of supportiveness a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Supporting our Customers</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have the opportunity &#8211; actually a responsibility &#8211; to support those both upstream and downstream in our business waterfall.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Paying customers 3 days early</strong>: Publishers were hit really hard by Covid. They pay their staff bi-monthly, but may get paid by advertisers/DSPs/SSPs, <em>months</em> after an ad is served. They are quite unfortunately at the bottom of the payment totem pole: it takes time for brands to pay agencies, for agencies to pay DSPs, and so on. We were in a position to pay publishers earlier than their contracts required us to, so we did. Three days may seem small, but it signaled that we had their backs. Industry media <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/finance-is-the-new-marketing-why-some-ad-tech-companies-are-paying-publishers-early/\">learned</a> what we were doing, and I have heard that it inspired other companies to follow suit.</li><li><strong>#HelpJournalism</strong>: A major industry issue during the pandemic has been that news publishers are delivering critical information (so their work is incredibly important), but because of keyword blocking around negative and/or political topics, they have seen ad revenue dry up. Just imagine: it was (and still is) standard for brands to not serve any ads on a page with words like: coronavirus, Trump, election, cases, riots, and the like. These keyword blocks starve news publishers of desperately needed ad dollars. We developed a specific deal to drive spend on news pubs and dropped our PMP fee to 0% to ensure they get every dollar. Customers like GroupM and others got <a href=\"https://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/triplelifts-help-journalism-program-incents-brands-to-advertise-against-hard-news/\">on board</a>, helping drive more spend to support journalism at a critical time.</li><li><strong>Underrepresented Voices ETDs: </strong>When racial tensions increased over the summer, we asked ourselves: ‘How we can support more sites owned by underrepresented communities?’ We created an ETD, called <a href=\"/exchange-traded-deals/unrep/\">UNREP</a>, comprised of sites majority-owned by women, minorities and LGBTQ.&nbsp; We were able to partner with <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/360/new-ways-support-multicultural-publishers-display-video-360\">Google</a> and others on the initiative and these packages are continuing to grow.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Supporting Society</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No company operates separate from the world. And, increasingly, we have found importance in contributing to the greater good.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Every Meeting Makes a Difference</strong>: Back in April, many customers didn’t feel up to taking meetings &#8212; there were obviously bigger things going on in the world. So we partnered with World Central Kitchen to donate 3 meals to frontline healthcare workers for every meeting customers’ scheduled with us. In June, the program pivoted to focus on supporting crucial DE&amp;I causes, specifically the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. In June alone, we had 1,182 meetings with customers, each unlocking a $5 donation to this worthy cause.</li><li><strong>Combating misinformation</strong>: Most sites that regularly publish misinformation are ad-supported. That means we have a responsibility to think about the types of companies and institutions that we want to be in business with. We took the step this year to fire 19 customers based on repeatedly publishing misinformation about coronavirus and the election. Stuff like, “Coronavirus is just the flu”, “Its caused by 5G”, and other misleading information that serves to confuse people when accurate health information is essential. Because we aren’t experts in determining misinformation, we became the first SSP to <a href=\"https://cheddar.com/media/misinformation-crackdowns-social-media\">partner with NewsGuard</a> to help ensure our publishers aren’t bad actors.</li><li><strong>$1 billion ad spend milestone</strong>: We hit an amazing milestone this year &#8211; $1 billion in lifetime ad spend. To celebrate this, we donated the amount of ad spend in our first year &#8211; $69,718 &#8211; to charities selected by TripleLifters. Hearing how much the donation means to an organization like Crisis Aid International is <a href=\"https://a.cl.ly/X6u0Lbp9\">heartwarming</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Supporting Our Employees</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around the world, people have needed to adjust to a new normal. We tried to make it easier to handle these challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Mental Health Days</strong>: It became clear in May 2020 that people needed a break &#8212; physically and mentally. The pandemic, the fight for racial justice, and a new way of working and living were taking their toll. So we instituted “Mental Health Days”, where everyone was encouraged to take 2 days off per month, in addition to any vacation or personal days. It started as a two-month thing, but given the feedback and results, we’ve kept it going since.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Work From Home Stipend</strong>: We try to make our offices nice. We’ve had all the fancy chairs and monitors and snacks and such. But we know that most of us have never worked from home before and haven’t put in the same effort into making sure it’s a comfortable, productive place to work. We started by giving everyone $500 to outfit their at home work environment. That helped, but we heard that people could use more to get everything they needed to be the most productive, so we added another $500 stipend to outfit a proper working environment.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Headspace subscription: </strong>Many people find meditation to be a powerful way to be less stressed, happier, and think more clearly. It’s not for everyone. For those at the company looking for a resource to help explain meditation and guide their own practice, we made the Headspace app available for free to everyone. About half the company has signed up.</li><li><strong>Q2 Pay Back Plan</strong>: As the company started to perform better, and ad spend rebounded, it became clear that the right thing to do was to retroactively restore all wages that were previously reduced in Q2 when the pandemic was at the apex of impacting our business.</li><li><strong>$1,000 Extra Bonus</strong>: TripleLift’s success is based on its people. Period. One way to acknowledge that is to demonstrate our appreciation by sharing in the company&#8217;s success. So this year, for the first time, everyone in the company received a $1,000 bonus, on top of any other eligible bonuses. It feels like the least we can do for the hard work our whole team has put in.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Each one of these things, on its own, is small. Taken together, they make a huge difference.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I look at what we did last year, laid out like this, it makes me so damn proud to work at this company. I hope you feel the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8212; Ari</p>\n","title":"Reflections on 2020","uri":"/blog/reflections-on-2020/","date":"January 13, 2021","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ef533f0dcd358b29a8677e8360e9cfbc/69209/Reflection_blog_1024x1024.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ef533f0dcd358b29a8677e8360e9cfbc/e9e8b/Reflection_blog_1024x1024.jpg 250w,\n/static/ef533f0dcd358b29a8677e8360e9cfbc/84742/Reflection_blog_1024x1024.jpg 500w,\n/static/ef533f0dcd358b29a8677e8360e9cfbc/69209/Reflection_blog_1024x1024.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ef533f0dcd358b29a8677e8360e9cfbc/98dbc/Reflection_blog_1024x1024.avif 250w,\n/static/ef533f0dcd358b29a8677e8360e9cfbc/92e1f/Reflection_blog_1024x1024.avif 500w,\n/static/ef533f0dcd358b29a8677e8360e9cfbc/9b3e4/Reflection_blog_1024x1024.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/ef533f0dcd358b29a8677e8360e9cfbc/0b151/Reflection_blog_1024x1024.webp 250w,\n/static/ef533f0dcd358b29a8677e8360e9cfbc/33dd0/Reflection_blog_1024x1024.webp 500w,\n/static/ef533f0dcd358b29a8677e8360e9cfbc/6429b/Reflection_blog_1024x1024.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyODA1MQ==","excerpt":"<p>Exploring Never-Before-Seen Research in OTT Environments Introduction A lot has changed since March.

The Coronavirus pandemic has made us rethink our government, work and family institutions. In part to connect with others and sometimes just to check out, we’re leaning into a living room experience around video content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Streaming television has become the new international pastime and it just so happens that the eruption of the streaming wars &#8212; with new services from Disney, NBCUniversal, WarnerMedia and Quibi &#8212; coincided with the necessary isolation of COVID.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts across industries are talking about how trends that were unfolding over a matter of decades, are accelerating into a matter of months. Nowhere is this more evident than in the streaming wars, where the <strong>consumer behaviors of the next two years are likely to define the winners and losers of the next two decades.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several new models emerging for brand-supported television including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Increased collaboration between programmers and brands</li><li>Lowered ad loads</li><li>Opt-in ads</li><li>New ad formats</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these trends are accelerating as the transition continues from traditional linear TV to streaming. Consumers in OTT environments will no longer accept the old fashion. <strong>They want brands to facilitate access to the programming they love, not get in the way.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To preserve a consumer experience that allows brand-supported TV to compete with brand-free and commercial-free content, AVOD streamers are moving away from interruptive ad formats and towards more integrated ad experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The new viewer-first ad experience will ask fans what they want, not just what they’re willing to tolerate. </strong>This begs the question, what will happen to the $100B global market for television advertising? Now, in ad-free environments &#8212; integrations and product placement have always been the de facto “ad product” if you will. And the market is ripe for both investment and technological innovation. According to <a href=\"https://www.pqmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/US-Product-Placement-15-12782105.pdf\">PQ Media Research &amp; Insights</a>, last year marked the 10th consecutive year of double digit growth for product placement revenue in the U.S., representing a more than $11B opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift has pioneered a programmatic OTT solution for integrating brands into premium programming in post-production.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part is, this requires no additional resources of show producers. And because no physical product is needed on set, it opens up the windows for marketers to get involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"has-theme-secondary-color has-text-color\"><strong>The Test</strong></h5>\n\n\n\n<p>The emerging “new normal” that everyone’s talking about is going to require new measurement. One of the first things we have to do is figure out if this new model is even going to work. So we’re starting with just that: publishing first-of-its-kind research to determine how audiences are engaging with our new ad products.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far the industry has yet to develop scientific methods to assess the return on investment in integrations. Production costs can be prohibitive. And there’s no “unit” or “unit cost”, therefore an academic approach to ROI analysis falls short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re designing measurement solutions from the ground up that directly correlates with business outcomes &#8212; and invite new conversations and new questions from stakeholders throughout the entire value chain, about the efficacy of integrations in television.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Questions such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>What is an impression?</li><li>What impact do brand integrations have on the perception of a show?</li><li>How often are brands seen when integrated in TV programming</li><li>Are brand integrations considered intrusive?</li><li>Do brand integrations increase the effectiveness of standard working media?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In partnership with <a href=\"https://www.mediasciencelabs.com/\">MediaScience</a>, TripleLift integrated 8 brands across 3 different categories (Alcohol, CPG and Food &amp; Beverage) into three different versions of the same episode: 1.) one that only had ad breaks without any integrations, 2.) one with just integrations and 3.) one version with integrations and their accompanying ads.

To appear on each list, companies need to demonstrate high rates of growth. And TripleLift has been bringing the goods for four straight years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Inc 5000 ranks companies across industries by revenue growth over a three-year period. In that span, TripleLift ranked #1,402. The Deloitte Fast 500 measures the fastest growing technology companies in North America and we came in at #202 on their list. Crain’s placed us at #24 on their list of fastest growing New York-based companies alongside impressive peers such as Lemonade, Peloton, Noom, Compass, WeWork and Brooklinen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part is that our metrics continue heading up. None of these surveys takes into account the full calendar year 2020, where our exponential growth has continued. So when we submit again next year we should have a good chance of making it five-for-five. We already know that 2020 will be our 9th consecutive year of high double digit (or more) revenue growth, and our 5th year in a row of accelerating profitability. Meaning: we are doing better year-over-year in our bottomline, even as we are getting larger in our topline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You routinely hear me talk about the balance of the human and math sides of our business. We focus attention and resources on our people to unlock success that materializes in our numbers. So, while we routinely celebrate our human accomplishments, it’s incredibly gratifying to receive acknowledgement for the results themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exceptional growth, driven by exceptional people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Congratulations to the whole team on these great distinctions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric</p>\n","title":"Ending the Year on a “Four-Peat” High Note","uri":"/blog/ending-the-year-on-a-four-peat-high-note/","date":"December 03, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/69209/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/e9e8b/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.jpg 250w,\n/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/84742/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.jpg 500w,\n/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/69209/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/98dbc/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.avif 250w,\n/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/92e1f/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.avif 500w,\n/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/9b3e4/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/0b151/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.webp 250w,\n/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/33dd0/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.webp 500w,\n/static/5c05cc4b775336c56dbb0cd59e01b57d/6429b/Four_Pear_blog_1024x1024.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNzAzNA==","excerpt":"<p>Welcome to TripleLift’s Publisher Spotlight Series!

Every month we’ll share an interview with one of our premium publishers, highlighting unique stories and uncovering valuable insights. This week we’re speaking with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/phil-bohn-7a98551/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Phil Bohn, SVP of Sales and Revenue at Mediavine</a>. Read on to learn how Mediavine uses SPO requirements as a differentiator and the surprising trait they have in common with Alexander Hamilton!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thanks for taking the time to answer our questions Phil! For starters, can you tell us about your role at Mediavine?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, and thanks for having me! My official title at Mediavine is SVP of Sales and Revenue. Most of my time is spent managing the Sales team, forging relationships with potential new partners/marketers, improving relationships with existing partners, or improving products, all in the name of revenue.<br><br>As part of my role, I am also required to use no less than 700 adtech acronyms per day. It is a very well kept secret in the industry that acronyms are negotiated upon hiring. (I kid, but actually just preparing you for the avalanche of acronyms below.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How are you dealing with the SPO opportunities of sellers.json, ads.txt, and more coming from DSPs?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the beginning<strong>, </strong>our goal at Mediavine has been to establish a safe, performance-driven environment for advertisers, therefore any efforts to improve transparency on the buy-side are aligned with our core philosophy. We’ve had to build out some functionality, but so far we have been able to accommodate these changes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supply Path Optimization is a little different. There are no set rules and a brand, an agency, or the DSP could be directing the optimizations. This means that SPO is one of our key discussion topics with partners and we’ve built internal reporting to monitor for any significant drop-offs from specific advertisers or DSPs, either through a single exchange or all exchanges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of today, we haven’t had any major issues and the few times there were concerns we were able to explain our strategy: Mediavine is providing the technology to allow thousands of independent publishers to add their billions of high performing ad impressions into the ecosystem, so keep the bidding and buying flowing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do those changes make it difficult to prove your directness as a network?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mediavine strives to find solutions well in advance of any deadlines required for such initiatives, so we’re never struggling to adapt at the last minute. However, these initiatives did require an extra layer of communication to understand how DSPs were auctioning off ads.txt and sellers.json, and to ensure Mediavine passed all necessary requirements.<br><br>We view these requirements as a way to set ourselves apart from other ad management providers and as an impetus to create a seamless solution for publishers and buyers. Once we explain the value proposition of the Mediavine Script Wrapper and our other products, plus our exclusivity clause with publishers, it is relatively easy to prove our directness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Are you seeing better performance or a specific share of voice from certain DSPs vs others?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our robust internal reporting focuses on dozens of metrics, and alongside an additional reporting set from our revenue partners, we have a unique snapshot into Mediavine’s performance levels. While we aim for diversity in our programmatic revenue streams, there are obviously a few publicly traded companies who tend to have a higher share of voice than others, but it isn’t by design.<br><br>According to our reporting, we generally perform better than our cohorts in key revenue-driving categories. While this could be what they tell all the publishers to boost their adtech self-esteem, we are extremely confident in our reporting and performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mediavine is the only Comscore Top 5 Lifestyle publisher with an audience that skews more than 70% female. Was that by design, or a natural development that you leaned into?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was absolutely by design in that Medavine prioritizes a clean and safe environment for marketers. We knew if we could scale our business with these priorities at the forefront, we would achieve higher CPMs and RPMs for our publishers. It turns out Food, Parenting, DIY, and Travel is very brand-safe content and tends to skew very female.<br><br>In other words, much like Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton, Mediavine is “reliable with the ladies!” (If you haven’t seen <em>Hamilton: An American Musical</em>, you have my sympathies. Please finish reading this blog post and go immediately to get a Disney+ subscription and watch. You’re welcome!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From a publisher perspective, what are the challenges that programmatic is facing right now that keep you up at night?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The current decline in bids from iOS/Safari traffic and the impending Chrome Cookie Massacre of 2021. For many, if not most of our 7,500+ publishers, Mediavine is their primary source of income. Continuing to optimize earnings for these small businesses in a rapidly changing ecosystem is both a challenge and our top priority.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are some of the advantages of working with Mediavine versus other publishers in your competitive set?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mediavine’s technology has been the linchpin of our company from day one. We built our own Script Wrapper and all of the optimizations within it, as well as our own instream video player, outstream video player, Open RTB server-to-server connections and, starting this year, our audience engagement framework and first-party data collection product, <a href=\"https://www.grow.me/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Grow.me</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have dedicated engineering teams to maintain, improve and grow all of these products. Mediavine’s technology and the people behind it set us apart in every respect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What has been your greatest learning moment this year? Why and what did you take away from it?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last year, we built our own Open RTB server-to-server solution. The plan was to use this to connect to smaller exchanges, minimizing latency. After extensive testing and optimizations, we’ve improved performance from all of our revenue partners over traditional on-page integrations. We expect to remove all on-page integrations in early 2021, dramatically improving pagespeed, SEO, viewability, and other key metrics.<br><br>Most of our exchange partners have told us that match rates are a major pain point in S2S connections, but we have solved for this issue and look forward to fully implementing our in-house S2S-only Script Wrapper in 2021.<br><br>So, here’s to 2021, the year of the Ox and the first 100% publisher-built server-to-server Script Wrapper! (Aka, the S2S-SW. Whew, just hit 700 acronyms for the day on the dot with that one. Clocking out to watch Hamilton now.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>For more information about TripleLift, our publishers, or how to be featured in a publisher spotlight, please&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"/contact-us/\" target=\"_blank\">contact us here</a>.</strong></em></p>\n","title":"Navigating Evolving DSP Dynamics with Mediavine","uri":"/blog/navigating-evolving-dsp-dynamics-with-mediavine/","date":"November 10, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7fba7a14e041a3a791ef9cbc62067438/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo_Mediavine.png","srcSet":"/static/7fba7a14e041a3a791ef9cbc62067438/5add7/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo_Mediavine.png 250w,\n/static/7fba7a14e041a3a791ef9cbc62067438/aef42/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo_Mediavine.png 500w,\n/static/7fba7a14e041a3a791ef9cbc62067438/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo_Mediavine.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/7fba7a14e041a3a791ef9cbc62067438/98dbc/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo_Mediavine.avif 250w,\n/static/7fba7a14e041a3a791ef9cbc62067438/92e1f/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo_Mediavine.avif 500w,\n/static/7fba7a14e041a3a791ef9cbc62067438/9b3e4/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo_Mediavine.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/7fba7a14e041a3a791ef9cbc62067438/0b151/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo_Mediavine.webp 250w,\n/static/7fba7a14e041a3a791ef9cbc62067438/33dd0/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo_Mediavine.webp 500w,\n/static/7fba7a14e041a3a791ef9cbc62067438/6429b/TL_PubSpotlight_Instagram_photo_Mediavine.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNjk5Mg==","excerpt":"<p>On November 8th 2020 (at precisely 1:49pm EST), TripleLift reached $1 Billion in lifetime ad spend.

The email below was sent by CEO Eric Berry to all employees commemorating this significant milestone in the company’s history.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift started with a vision about improving advertising. It was a risky and untested idea and it required creating an entirely new part of the programmatic ecosystem. Over the next several years, we were incredibly fortunate that the market validated our approach to the degree that we quickly became one of the fastest growing ad tech companies in history, and have sustained that growth across time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift has now crossed $1 billion in lifetime ad spend. A billion dollars have now run through our pipes. More impressively, over half of that total has transacted this year alone. It took us nine years to get to a billion but, with half of it coming in just 12 months, we are growing&#8230;fast. That&#8217;s an average rate of increase in ad spend over 70% every year of our existence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift was fortunate to have started with a view about how to improve advertising that was aligned with where publishers, marketers and consumers wanted the ecosystem to go. But we’ve been even more fortunate that the publishers and marketers we work with are indeed true partners that are excited to collaborate with us on the next stage of our journey.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe that good fortune is an important part of any company’s success. But we also believe that successful companies have a clear view of what defines them. For TripleLift, it’s our three P’s:</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Priorities</strong>. From the beginning, our business was set up so that “we only win when everyone wins.” If consumers get better ad experiences, our advertisers see better performance. If advertisers see better performance, our publishers earn more revenue. It’s a flywheel that makes TripleLift a business that works for everyone in the ecosystem. It starts with our commitment to publishers. Our direct relationships across the ecosystem mean no waste, and the lowest rate of fraud in the industry. We didn’t take shortcuts to achieve our scale and, now that we’re here, that decision is an annuity that drives us forward. Our priorities deliver results and they drive our product decisions.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Products</strong>. Creating an entirely new part of the ad tech value chain with native advertising, then doing it again with branded content, and yet again with OTT brand integrations requires a true commitment to being a product and technology forward company that isn’t afraid to experiment with new ideas, that isn’t afraid to try things that might not work, and that isn’t afraid to lean in when things start to pay off.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>People</strong>. We are confident that we have the best team in the industry. A team that believes in our mission, and a mission that resonates across the industry. Our people drive trust. Together, we have built a company to be envied. To make advertising work for everyone, ‘we go beyond.’ Our product and engineering teams have developed entirely new lines of business nearly every year. And our almost 200 customer-facing TripleLifters are so focused on our customers’ success that our retention and growth metrics exceed many of the most successful SaaS businesses.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe these principles have been instrumental in our success, and also position us well for the future. We know that technology continues to move forward at break-neck speed, and we have solutions for that. We know that television is ripe for disruption, and we have products for that. We know that privacy policies will create both challenge <em>and</em> opportunity, and we have plans for that. Our latest products &#8211; and those quickly emerging from our roadmap &#8211; will get us to where we are going tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Forgive me if this note feels like flag waving. But this is a seminal moment in the history of our company and I could not be more proud of what we have accomplished together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In honor of our achievement, we’re giving every TripleLifter the chance to make a donation to meaningful causes. While this has been a good year for our company, it has been a difficult year for so many people: in our industry, our home countries and around the world. To share the good fortune born of our hard work, we have selected 6 causes that can use our help. We’re donating $69,718 &#8212; the amount of ad spend we brought in during our first year of operations. Select the one that is most meaningful to you, and we will direct your slice of the dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There seems no more fitting way to mark this achievement, to honor how we got here, and to pay it forward on our way to the next $1 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric</p>\n","title":"TripleLift Crosses $1 Billion Dollar Lifetime Ad Spend Milestone","uri":"/blog/the-billion-dollar-company/","date":"November 09, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ea91eb8fdf9b5b7d2e4982358b0ef6b3/69209/BillionDollar_blog_1024x1024.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ea91eb8fdf9b5b7d2e4982358b0ef6b3/e9e8b/BillionDollar_blog_1024x1024.jpg 250w,\n/static/ea91eb8fdf9b5b7d2e4982358b0ef6b3/84742/BillionDollar_blog_1024x1024.jpg 500w,\n/static/ea91eb8fdf9b5b7d2e4982358b0ef6b3/69209/BillionDollar_blog_1024x1024.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ea91eb8fdf9b5b7d2e4982358b0ef6b3/98dbc/BillionDollar_blog_1024x1024.avif 250w,\n/static/ea91eb8fdf9b5b7d2e4982358b0ef6b3/92e1f/BillionDollar_blog_1024x1024.avif 500w,\n/static/ea91eb8fdf9b5b7d2e4982358b0ef6b3/9b3e4/BillionDollar_blog_1024x1024.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/ea91eb8fdf9b5b7d2e4982358b0ef6b3/0b151/BillionDollar_blog_1024x1024.webp 250w,\n/static/ea91eb8fdf9b5b7d2e4982358b0ef6b3/33dd0/BillionDollar_blog_1024x1024.webp 500w,\n/static/ea91eb8fdf9b5b7d2e4982358b0ef6b3/6429b/BillionDollar_blog_1024x1024.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoyNjUwMQ==","excerpt":"<p>Authored by: Sonja Kristiansen, VP Platform Partnerships, TripleLift The very definition of Native &#8211; fully integrated, non-standard ad experiences &#8211; is the reason that placements are so varied today.

Instead, they are beholden to algorithms that determine which Native placement type they end up with.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><span class=\"wp-image-26058 inline-gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%;width:1200px\" data-reactroot=\"\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"width:100%;padding-bottom:87.66666666666667%\"></span><img aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAASABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIDAf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAB/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAGKy2lySTWw6K//xAAaEAACAwEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAgADERIQ/9oACAEBAAEFAjGrPONByY9gCahm+//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQMBAT8BH//EABQRAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACD/2gAIAQIBAT8BH//EABoQAAICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABETEgIUL/2gAIAQEABj8CtE0cj0U8f//EABwQAQACAgMBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAMREhEEFxYf/aAAgBAQABPyEHVkxYtTDAA663KJ59hgq+y4m/WCwbag8f/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABCTP7z/xAAXEQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEBEh/9oACAEDAQE/EKa//8QAFxEAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABARIf/aAAgBAgEBPxCaR//EAB8QAQEBAAEDBQAAAAAAAAAAAAERACExQVFhcYGRsf/aAAgBAQABPxCAOV3cfGkKECsNSJFNKv1i4cIti8vfENhAq06e2W3i6mP209c1OXV8u//Z\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:0;transition-delay:500ms\"/><picture><source srcSet=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/37e03/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 300w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/2a8be/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 600w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/5a523/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1200w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/54987/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1487w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\"/><img sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcSet=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/37e03/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 300w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/2a8be/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 600w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/5a523/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1200w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/54987/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1487w\" src=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/5a523/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition:opacity 500ms\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source srcset=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/37e03/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 300w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/2a8be/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 600w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/5a523/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1200w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/54987/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1487w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /><img loading=\"eager\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" srcset=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/37e03/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 300w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/2a8be/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 600w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/5a523/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1200w,\n/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/54987/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg 1487w\" src=\"/static/33d5ec1c7691a7310c774d4d44ffc9e7/5a523/Scotch-Brite-Native-Ads-TripleLift.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center\"/></picture></noscript></span></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In comparison, video, another form of advertising with an array of creative experiences, has wide adoption in targeting, transparency and reporting around the different formats available. The idea of having no controls across in-stream, out-stream, CTV or in-banner video buying would be absurd. As a result every leading DSP with video buying capabilities has targeting controls for different placement types, enabling marketers to pick and choose the video inventory that best suits their goals. Although standard for video, most DSPs are still grappling with how to integrate this level of sophistication into their Native inventory targeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Early Adopters&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift placements are classified by placement type in the bid request, making it possible for DSPs to decision on behalf of advertiser needs. DSPs like DV360 and Zemanta are paving the way by providing their buyers with Native Placement Type targeting capabilities, giving marketers more opportunities to be selective in their Native needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this targeting capability, it is important for advertisers to understand the key differences between Native placement types such as user experience and performance, to make an informed decision.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>User Experience</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One major difference in Native ad types is the design of the placement itself, and ultimately the user experience. In-Feed ads are integrated into the stream of content, and often match the look and feel of the publisher environment, while Recommendation Widgets group multiple ads, typically below articles and feeds within fixed placements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From an advertiser perspective, these are dramatically different ad experiences, yet, they are all defined as “Native”. Advertisers may be surprised to learn that their Native ad is running alongside a group of other ads within a widget, when they intended their ad to live within the stream of content with 100% SOV, like 90% of TripleLift placements.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Performance Polarization</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from user experience, different Native ad types have very different performance benchmarks. In a blind placement type test conducted by TripleLift and a major DSP, In-Article performance was 64% higher than Recommendation widgets, while TripleLift’s In-Article performance was an additional 22% higher than other exchange’s In-Article placements. When considering the visuals above, this may come as no surprise &#8212; performance follows user attention, and user attention lives within the stream of content they intend to consume. Considering that most programmatic advertisers optimize towards user attention and performance, the Native placement type marketers choose can make a meaningful difference on campaign success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Continued Change</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the advent of Native Placement Type Targeting nears, transparency across the entire buying ecosystem will be imperative. We expect to see a wave of adjustments come over the industry as more information around placement type location and performance becomes readily available to help marketers make informed decisions. For DSPs, we anticipate more controls will be added to bring parity to targeting across all formats, including Native.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/contact-us/?utm_source=int&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=native-equal\">Reach out to us</a> to learn how you can start targeting quality Native Placement Types today.&nbsp;</p>\n","title":"Not All Native is Created Equal","uri":"/blog/not-all-native-is-created-equal/","date":"October 16, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/400e09c80f3cb13ab52c1ce76ee834c6/69209/TL_NativeNotEqual_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.jpg","srcSet":"/static/400e09c80f3cb13ab52c1ce76ee834c6/e9e8b/TL_NativeNotEqual_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.jpg 250w,\n/static/400e09c80f3cb13ab52c1ce76ee834c6/84742/TL_NativeNotEqual_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.jpg 500w,\n/static/400e09c80f3cb13ab52c1ce76ee834c6/69209/TL_NativeNotEqual_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/400e09c80f3cb13ab52c1ce76ee834c6/98dbc/TL_NativeNotEqual_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.avif 250w,\n/static/400e09c80f3cb13ab52c1ce76ee834c6/92e1f/TL_NativeNotEqual_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.avif 500w,\n/static/400e09c80f3cb13ab52c1ce76ee834c6/9b3e4/TL_NativeNotEqual_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/400e09c80f3cb13ab52c1ce76ee834c6/0b151/TL_NativeNotEqual_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.webp 250w,\n/static/400e09c80f3cb13ab52c1ce76ee834c6/33dd0/TL_NativeNotEqual_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.webp 500w,\n/static/400e09c80f3cb13ab52c1ce76ee834c6/6429b/TL_NativeNotEqual_Blog_1500x1500_NL1-1.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"offset":9,"postsPerPage":9,"nextPagePath":"/blog/3","previousPagePath":"/blog"}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
