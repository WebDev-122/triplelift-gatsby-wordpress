By prioritizing authentic storytelling. This is especially critical for video advertising, because strategic changes can make or break whether an ad gets watched or ignored.</p>\n<p>TripleLift set out to find out how thought leaders in the industry are using video to cut through the noise and make real connections with audiences. We invited <strong>Alyson Griffin, VP of Global Marketing at Intel; Dave Kersey, SVP Group Director at Carat; and Beth Traglia, Director, Content Strategy and Social Media Marketing at Farmers Insurance</strong> to our &#8216;The Future of Video Storytelling&#8217; event in Los Angeles to discuss how they leverage video advertising to tell authentic stories. TripleLift’s General Manager of International, John Stoneman, moderated the conversation.</p>\n<p>So, what’s next for video advertising?</p>\n<p>Brands will need to leave their comfort zones and take creative risks in order to stand out. Watch the full video below to see how brands are creating concierge-level experiences with personalized video, why over-branding can actually break trust, and how a willingness to fail may just generate the best ideas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"The Future of Storytelling: Industry Thought Leaders Reveal What’s Next for Video Advertising\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G3XsucJxD_g?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n","title":"The Future of Storytelling: Industry Thought Leaders Reveal What’s Next for Video Advertising","uri":"/blog/video-advertising-event-october-2019/","date":"November 25, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OA==","name":"Native advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTozNzk=","name":"native video ads"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxOTU=","name":"Video Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2f9e09dc16c4ba733fbb1107c8cb059c/69209/112519_FutureStorytelling-1500x1500.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2f9e09dc16c4ba733fbb1107c8cb059c/e9e8b/112519_FutureStorytelling-1500x1500.jpg 250w,\n/static/2f9e09dc16c4ba733fbb1107c8cb059c/84742/112519_FutureStorytelling-1500x1500.jpg 500w,\n/static/2f9e09dc16c4ba733fbb1107c8cb059c/69209/112519_FutureStorytelling-1500x1500.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/2f9e09dc16c4ba733fbb1107c8cb059c/98dbc/112519_FutureStorytelling-1500x1500.avif 250w,\n/static/2f9e09dc16c4ba733fbb1107c8cb059c/92e1f/112519_FutureStorytelling-1500x1500.avif 500w,\n/static/2f9e09dc16c4ba733fbb1107c8cb059c/9b3e4/112519_FutureStorytelling-1500x1500.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/2f9e09dc16c4ba733fbb1107c8cb059c/0b151/112519_FutureStorytelling-1500x1500.webp 250w,\n/static/2f9e09dc16c4ba733fbb1107c8cb059c/33dd0/112519_FutureStorytelling-1500x1500.webp 500w,\n/static/2f9e09dc16c4ba733fbb1107c8cb059c/6429b/112519_FutureStorytelling-1500x1500.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/europe-holiday-advertising-shopping-trends-2019/","title":"Holiday Shopland: What European Advertisers Should Know About Holiday Shopping in 2019 "},"next":{"uri":"/blog/supply-path-optimization-questions-ask-exchange/","title":"Creating Your SPO Strategy?
