TripleLift’s Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer Ari Lewine believes so.</p>\n<p>At IAB UK Engage 2019, Ari’s presentation ‘<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RV35QpDncfI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Video Advertising &amp; Our Brains</a>’ highlights that while both banner blindness and ad blockers are on the rise, the industry’s response has generally been to make ads bigger and more intrusive. Instead of offering a naturally engaging experience, the industry has convinced itself that relying on forced views is working.</p>\n<p>But really, it alienates people — and the industry knows it. There’s ample evidence to show that video engagement and brand recall are suffering due to ineffective video ads. Ari also reminds us that those in the advertising industry are also consumers.

Ari believes it’s due to cognitive dissonance — the act of knowing one thing and feeling or doing another. In this video, Ari unpacks why humans act against their own knowledge, and introduces ways to fix that with a new business model that centers people. He also unveils a new non-interruptive video format that matches the look and feel of a publisher — one that receives view rates as high as 75% and 38% higher brand recall than traditional outstream video.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch the full video below!</strong></p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"Ari Lewine at Engage 2019\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RV35QpDncfI?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","title":"Video Advertising & Our Brains: Watch Ari Lewine at IAB UK Engage 2019 ","uri":"/blog/video-advertising-our-brains-watch-ari-lewine-iab-uk-engage-2019/","date":"June 26, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5479d1888a9b69bf1e2cbc1d4bb447d3/69209/062619_VideoAdvertisingAndBrainsAriVideo-1500x1500.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5479d1888a9b69bf1e2cbc1d4bb447d3/e9e8b/062619_VideoAdvertisingAndBrainsAriVideo-1500x1500.jpg 250w,\n/static/5479d1888a9b69bf1e2cbc1d4bb447d3/84742/062619_VideoAdvertisingAndBrainsAriVideo-1500x1500.jpg 500w,\n/static/5479d1888a9b69bf1e2cbc1d4bb447d3/69209/062619_VideoAdvertisingAndBrainsAriVideo-1500x1500.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5479d1888a9b69bf1e2cbc1d4bb447d3/98dbc/062619_VideoAdvertisingAndBrainsAriVideo-1500x1500.avif 250w,\n/static/5479d1888a9b69bf1e2cbc1d4bb447d3/92e1f/062619_VideoAdvertisingAndBrainsAriVideo-1500x1500.avif 500w,\n/static/5479d1888a9b69bf1e2cbc1d4bb447d3/9b3e4/062619_VideoAdvertisingAndBrainsAriVideo-1500x1500.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/5479d1888a9b69bf1e2cbc1d4bb447d3/0b151/062619_VideoAdvertisingAndBrainsAriVideo-1500x1500.webp 250w,\n/static/5479d1888a9b69bf1e2cbc1d4bb447d3/33dd0/062619_VideoAdvertisingAndBrainsAriVideo-1500x1500.webp 500w,\n/static/5479d1888a9b69bf1e2cbc1d4bb447d3/6429b/062619_VideoAdvertisingAndBrainsAriVideo-1500x1500.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/branded-video-advertising-engagement-eye-tracking-study/","title":"Eye Tracking Study Reveals the Video Ads That Actually Get Viewed & Why"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/triplelift-ceo-eric-berry-named-winner-ey-entrepreneur-of-the-year-2019-new-york-awards-marketing-advertising/","title":"TripleLift’s CEO Eric Berry Named Winner of EY Entrepreneur Of The Year® 2019 New York Awards in Marketing and Advertising"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDo0Mjg0","previousPostId":"cG9zdDo0Mjkz","nextPostId":"cG9zdDo0MjY3"}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
