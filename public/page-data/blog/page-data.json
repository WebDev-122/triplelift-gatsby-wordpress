Whether that is scrolling on a website or in a mobile app, watching online video or viewing a show on connected TV, video is everywhere and so are the advertising opportunities. To help brands and advertisers reach audiences wherever they are watching, TripleLift is launching a full funnel suite of video solutions for online video and connected TV. The suite of solutions includes ad formats and experiences for the three ways audiences consume video content: In-Feed, In-Break and In-Show.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://new.triplelift.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Website-Blog-article-image-800x300-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-31758\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jacqueline Quantrell, TripleLift’s Chief Revenue Officer, reflects on the next era of digital advertising: “As video consumption habits evolve and time spent across all devices remains on the rise, it is increasingly important for video solutions to reflect these changes. As a top three programmatic video supply partner<sup>1</sup> with over 25,000 publisher partners across online video and connected TV, and the only Supply Side Partner to offer a full funnel portfolio of video solutions, TripleLift is uniquely positioned to help advertisers achieve their performance goals.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With TripleLift In-Feed video formats, advertisers can reach audiences directly within a feed of content. These ad units match the unique look and feel of each publisher site and offer customized branding that can drive up to 9X the purchase intent compared to a standard digital video ad.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For advertisers looking to drive both awareness and consideration among target audiences, TripleLift’s video portfolio includes In-Break formats for online video and connected TV including In-Stream Video and Connected TV Spots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, currently in a private beta, TripleLift is pioneering new programmatic In-Show ad formats that are organic, integrated and less interruptive than traditional television advertising.&nbsp; TripleLift In-Show ad formats include CTV Integrated Ad Experiences: Dynamic Overlays, Split Screen Units, and Brand Integrations, all informed by machine learning technology and a creative team of integrated marketers, and all delivered dynamically via automation. TripleLift’s integrated ad experiences effectively deliver upper funnel metrics including increased engagement<sup>3</sup> and brand awareness.<sup>4</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://new.triplelift.com/video\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more here about how TripeLift’s video portfolio can help you achieve your KPIs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><sup>1</sup> DV360, Feb 2021 Inventory Availability Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><sup>2</sup> TripleLift, Kantar MWB Norms: Consumables, Video Format: n=457 campaigns</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><sup>3</sup> <em>TripleLift, MediaScience In-Show Integrations Study 2021</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><sup>4</sup><em>TripleLift, Millward Brown Brand Lift, Video Format Study 2021</em></p>\n","title":"TripleLift Ushers in Next Era of Digital Video Advertising with Full-Funnel, Suite of Video Solutions","uri":"/blog/triplelift-ushers-in-next-era-of-digital-video-advertising-with-full-funnel-suite-of-video-solutions/","date":"May 07, 2021","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/8f3c3/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.png","srcSet":"/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/5add7/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.png 250w,\n/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/aef42/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.png 500w,\n/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/8f3c3/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/98dbc/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.avif 250w,\n/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/92e1f/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.avif 500w,\n/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/9b3e4/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/0b151/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.webp 250w,\n/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/33dd0/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.webp 500w,\n/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/6429b/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDozMTU1Mw==","excerpt":"<p>Welcome to TripleLift’s Publisher Spotlight Series.

Every month we share an interview with one of our publisher partners, highlighting unique stories and uncovering valuable insights. This month, we are featuring a two-part spotlight with <a href=\"/blog/a-nickels-worth-of-freestar-advice-insights-from-ceo-kurt-donnell/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Freestar’s CEO, Kurt Donnell. In Part 1, Donnell offered readers an inside look at </a>Freestar’s impressive growth, what attracted him to the company and how his team remains devoted to client satisfaction. Now, Donnell shares how the Freestar team is navigating<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurtdonnell/\"> </a>industry challenges, what publishers should be considering when it comes to video and gives us a sneak peek at what’s ahead for the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>From all appearances, Freestar’s publishers are thrilled to be working with you &#8211; what do you think they would say is the best part of your partnership?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of companies can offer similar technology to ours, but the service and the custom solutions that we offer are truly unmatched in the industry. As much as we will continue to iterate and innovate on our tech and products, I feel that our publishers would overwhelmingly say our best feature is our team, which is very intentional. I firmly believe that if you take care of your employees and take care of your customers, a lot of other things will take care of themselves. Accordingly, we start with our employees and constantly push ourselves to give them what they need to be successful which in turn lets them better serve our clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a company, we understand that we will always be a client-facing organization first and foremost, and it shows in our day-to-day internal interactions. One of our most active Slack channels (which happens to be my personal favorite) is our NPS channel where the whole company gets real-time, unfiltered feedback from our publishers when responses to our monthly NPS survey are submitted. It is always so great to see people across every team in the organization come together to celebrate and/or learn whenever we have new responses come in from publishers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The industry faces immense change with the imminent death of the third-party cookie, Apple&#8217;s iOS 14 update, and a myriad of new state-led privacy regulations. How can publishers best prepare for these changes? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone that has been in this industry over the years, we all understand the only real constant is change and that every three months or so there will be something new to address. GDPR, CCPA, and the other U.S. states to follow &#8211; and potentially federal mandates &#8211; are just one element of the change in consumer protections. Add in the third-party cookies and IDFA changes and publishers rightly have a lot to be thinking about, however we as an industry have always found ways to address changes and challenges, and this will be no different. While I don’t know that anyone can definitively say what the solution will be to address the lack of third-party cookies, there are already so many different solutions being tested that I have no doubt there will be viable options that meet the needs of publishers and advertisers alike.<br><br>For a single publisher, who is handling all of their ad tech in-house, I’d recommend trying to test as many targeting solutions as possible in 2021 and staying up-to-date on the future of privacy and the demise of the third-party cookie through the various industry resources (such as AdExchanger, Digiday, eMarketer, AdWeek to name a few). There is also no shortage of online webinars that cover the various changes in the industry. Finally, I encourage publishers to join the conversation when possible through groups like IAB or Prebid.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With regard to privacy compliance, it is important for publishers to vet their Consent Management Platform (CMP) provider thoroughly and remember that you often get what you pay for. A free tool simply cannot offer you the same service as a solution you pay for. As a self-proclaimed “recovering attorney”, I would also be remiss if I didn’t suggest you seek the advice of counsel on anything you do or implement on your site that is compliance-related.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For publishers, e-commerce companies, or app developers that don’t want to go it alone, ad management companies like Freestar can often help mitigate the headaches of addressing the ever changing world of ad tech (in addition to increasing revenue!). As ad tech is all we do, targeting, compliance and all of the other nuances of our crazy industry are challenges we work to solve all day every day on behalf of our clients so they don’t have to. But I am admittedly a bit biased on this point.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In the last year, we&#8217;ve witnessed an acceleration in the demand for premium video inventory across all formats. In-app and in-feed are no exception. Are there any trends or insights that Freestar has uncovered that publishers should consider when looking to increase yield as it relates to video? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I like to encourage publishers to do is to add video and video advertising opportunities to their site without monetization being the sole purpose behind the initiative. We always take a balanced approach with our publishers around user experience and revenue, and that is especially important with video products. Video products in the right place at the right time will not only drive better revenue, but will also keep your users coming back and consuming more content &#8211; which ultimately is what we all want for the health of the open web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you have any sneak peaks of advancements that either publishers or advertisers should be looking out for in the coming months?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are working toward offering a number of unique ad unit experiences that will be available exclusively for direct-sold and PMP deals. As we continue to grow that piece of our business, we want to ensure we offer both publishers and advertisers unique solutions that meet their needs. We also will continue to add new features and support for additional ad units and integration types to our app monetization platform that is very unique in the ad management space. Lastly, we will continue to build on our Ideal Ad Stack technology to ensure we optimize the value of every ad impression we manage for our publishers. Ultimately, we remain committed to building products that further cement Freestar as the one-stop shop for publishers, e-commerce sites, app developers and advertisers who want to optimize revenue and performance.</p>\n","title":"Part 2 : A Nickel’s Worth of Freestar Advice, Insights from CEO Kurt Donnell","uri":"/blog/a-nickels-worth-of-freestar-advice-insights-from-ceo-kurt-donnell-part2/","date":"March 30, 2021","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.png","srcSet":"/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/5add7/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.png 250w,\n/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/aef42/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.png 500w,\n/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/98dbc/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.avif 250w,\n/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/92e1f/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.avif 500w,\n/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/9b3e4/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/0b151/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.webp 250w,\n/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/33dd0/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.webp 500w,\n/static/3cf4b06990667e1cf97c8f0ef1cc9d99/6429b/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2-1.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDozMTU0MA==","excerpt":"<p>The following email was sent to all TripleLift employees immediately following an all-hands meeting where Co-Founder and CEO Eric Berry announced the acquisition of the company by Vista Equity Partners.&nbsp; TripleLift announced today that a majority stake of the company will be acquired by Vista Equity Partners, a leading private equity firm focused on software, [&hellip;]</p>\n","content":"\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The following email was sent to all TripleLift employees immediately following an all-hands meeting where Co-Founder and CEO Eric Berry announced the acquisition of the company by Vista Equity Partners.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift announced today that a majority stake of the company will be acquired by Vista Equity Partners, a leading private equity firm focused on software, data and technology-enabled businesses.

This alignment will also create positive effects for our customers and partners as it provides us with the ability to service them in an increasing number of ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me provide some details about this agreement, explain why we entered into it, articulate what it means to our future and share what comes next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are the details of this investment?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift has been acquired by Vista Equity Partners. This should be a moment of pride for every TripleLifter past and present. We started the business in 2012 with a central idea to bring Native ads to the open web. Through your hard work, we have delivered on that original thesis, expanded to become a large and well regarded programmatic exchange, and have begun commercializing a truly differentiated CTV business. These three chapters of our company’s history &#8211; and our ability to demonstrate proficiency in each one of them &#8211; is what created the value leading to this transaction. TripleLift and Vista will be working together to evaluate key drivers for successful growth moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why did we make this decision?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift has grown over 70% annually since 2015, and we are committed to building on our leadership position going forward. This acquisition ensures that we are well capitalized to follow through on our strategic plan:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Maintaining our leadership position in Native</li><li>Expanding our position in programmatic video where we are a Top 3 provider</li><li>Catalyzing our opportunity in CTV</li><li>Further expanding into priority international markets across Europe &amp; Asia</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Vista is a value-added investor with an extensive track record of helping companies achieve excellence by contributing professional expertise and proven best practices. They will be a powerful resource as we move into this next chapter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What does the acquisition mean?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the highest level, let me start with the old adage: “the more things change, the more they stay the same.” Vista made this investment in TripleLift for the growth opportunity ahead of us. They bought us for our strategy, our priorities, our brand and our values. None of that changes. As we always have, we will revisit our plans as market circumstances dictate, but we will now have those discussions with Vista instead of our current board of directors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike Fosnaugh, the Co-Head of the Flagship Fund at Vista remarked to me the other day: “Your team has built something extraordinary. Our goal is to help you reach the goals we’ve been discussing. We will help you grow into your ambitions, not change what you’ve built.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What happens next?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We anticipate that the deal will officially close in Q2 2021, once government regulators have had a chance to review the acquisition. Until and beyond that point, it is business as usual. We’ve got an industry to keep changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to everyone on this team for living our values and driving us to this day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eric</p>\n","title":"TripleLift Acquired by Vista Equity Partners","uri":"/blog/triplelift-acquired-by-vista-equity-partners/","date":"March 29, 2021","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/8f3c3/TripleLift-Logo.png","srcSet":"/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/5add7/TripleLift-Logo.png 250w,\n/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/aef42/TripleLift-Logo.png 500w,\n/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/8f3c3/TripleLift-Logo.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/98dbc/TripleLift-Logo.avif 250w,\n/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/92e1f/TripleLift-Logo.avif 500w,\n/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/9b3e4/TripleLift-Logo.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/0b151/TripleLift-Logo.webp 250w,\n/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/33dd0/TripleLift-Logo.webp 500w,\n/static/ce958e0024c7d8b46074d3c4d302b948/6429b/TripleLift-Logo.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDozMTUyNA==","excerpt":"<p>Welcome to TripleLift’s Publisher Spotlight Series.

Read on for Kurt’s insight on Freestar’s impressive growth, what attracted him to the company, and what it takes to remain devoted to client satisfaction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thank you for speaking with us! Can you tell us about your role at Freestar?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for having me. It has been a pleasure working with TripleLift over the years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My role as President and CEO has continued to evolve since I joined the company in January 2019. When I started with the company, we were still under 30 people and needed to build or formalize a lot of areas of the business from both a systems and employee standpoint. In the first year or so, I spent a lot of time working to ensure we had a scalable foundation in place for some more basic things like accounting and HR and automated a number of time-intensive processes. I also was hyper-focused on building a very customer service-oriented business, both from a culture standpoint and hiring the right teams, which has paid dividends as evidenced by our NPS scores that are consistently above 70 on a monthly basis. Of course helping to chart the long term vision and direction of the business has been a huge priority since day one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we have continued to grow, now over 75 employees, my focus has shifted a bit more to hiring, team structure and leadership development. I always want to ensure we have the right people in the right roles, and that they have the bandwidth and tools to execute at a high level. Accordingly, I spend a lot of time with employees at all levels of our organization to understand and alleviate their pain points and do a lot of work with our management group to encourage accountability and ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What attracted you to the company?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With regard to what brought me to Freestar, I met the founders of Freestar early in their journey and almost joined them 2 years before I eventually did. Perhaps foolishly, I decided to go another direction and joined YogaWorks as EVP of Partnerships and General Counsel where I had the chance to help the company through its IPO and significant growth through acquisitions. Throughout my time at YogaWorks, I stayed in touch with the Freestar founders and was continually impressed with what they were doing and the way they were doing it. I also realized I missed the constant change and need to adapt in the world of ad tech, so it was an incredibly easy decision when the founders asked if I would be interested in coming on board to help lead the next stage of growth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being able to join the company when I did was truly a blessing. There were already so many good bones in place, we just needed some operational and administrative improvements that we have thankfully been able to implement. The last two years have undoubtedly been the most fulfilling of my career and it truly feels like we are just getting started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Freestar has seen unbelievable growth over the past few years. How has the company changed since you first started?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have certainly changed a lot from a headcount standpoint in the last couple years, tripling in size and hiring 39 new employees in 2020 alone. During that time we went from having offices in Phoenix (our headquarters), New York and Los Angeles to a majority remote team in 2019 when we shifted our focus to hiring the very best people, no matter where they were located. Our early adoption of remote culture unknowingly set us up incredibly well to become a fully-remote company in 2020, which we plan to continue indefinitely.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With our decision to hire employees outside of cities with offices, we had to evolve our culture to ensure that we were still growing incredible employees despite not seeing them daily. We instituted a number of things in 2019, like full company offsites, which we have since switched to very successful virtual retreats in 2020, an ongoing monthly speaker series, new women’s and diversity committees, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major change was weaving our obsession with client satisfaction into everything we do. Much of our success &#8211; such as being the number 1 fastest growing company on the 2019 Inc. 5000 list which we followed up with a number 36 ranking in 2020 &#8211; has been driven by retention and growth of existing customers, not just new customers. We spend a ton of time and energy to improve our processes and we never allow ourselves to rest on our laurels. Be it increasing headcount on our client success team, improving our external dashboard, building new ad products or making upgrades to internal systems, we always strive to get 1% better each week and make our customer’s experiences with us remarkable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We&#8217;ve all learned over the past year that prioritizing mental health is important. What are some of the things you&#8217;ve been doing lately when you need to take a break?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no denying that the pandemic has taken a toll on all of us in a myriad of ways. While working from home certainly has its perks, it is very easy to instantly be at your desk when you wake up in the morning and find yourself there until well after dinner time. As a result, my team and I have taken a deeper look at our home office lives and have been trying to set the example that getting outside and taking mental health breaks is important. I personally make it a point to try to walk or hike most days of the week, squeeze in golf whenever I can, and take road trips to get a change of scenery while flying has been out of the picture. Like most companies, we have also been extra flexible for our employees with children, allowing them to work schedules that match up with the needs of their family which is ultimately the most important thing in their life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"/blog/a-nickels-worth-of-freestar-advice-insights-from-ceo-kurt-donnell-part2/\">Click here for part 2 of our conversation with Freestar’s CEO, Kurt Donnell.</a></p>\n","title":"A Nickel’s Worth of Freestar Advice: Insights from CEO Kurt Donnell","uri":"/blog/a-nickels-worth-of-freestar-advice-insights-from-ceo-kurt-donnell/","date":"March 24, 2021","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.png","srcSet":"/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/5add7/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.png 250w,\n/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/aef42/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.png 500w,\n/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/8f3c3/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/98dbc/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.avif 250w,\n/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/92e1f/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.avif 500w,\n/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/9b3e4/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/0b151/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.webp 250w,\n/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/33dd0/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.webp 500w,\n/static/eff5cd41890afd832fcab9c060477a28/6429b/TL_PubSpotlight_Newsletter2.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDozMTMxNQ==","excerpt":"<p>In 2020, we saw hundreds of brands and small businesses pull ads from social platforms after it became clear that their content moderation practices allowed for the spread of misinformation and hate speech.&nbsp; While these platforms have taken small steps to stamp out fake news and hate propaganda, reports of assaults against fact and truth [&hellip;]</p>\n","content":"\n<p>In 2020, we saw hundreds of brands and small businesses pull ads from social platforms after it became clear that their content moderation practices allowed for the spread of misinformation and hate speech.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While these platforms have taken small steps to stamp out fake news and hate propaganda, reports of assaults against fact and truth continue to crop up.

Market shifts occur every day through audience behaviors, acquisitions, new partners, regulatory changes and more. Simultaneously, the promise of incremental revenue and audience attraction has many publishers finding themselves racking up complex tech stacks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As new macro trends emerge and revenue opportunities abound, publishers need strategies that can withstand the test of time. But, assessing each partner&#8217;s value in relation to publishers&#8217; overall strategy comes at the expense of time and money. What if an established approach is still the best way for publishers to set themselves up for success, no matter the market volatility or business complexities they face?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yield management has been in practice since the advent of programmatic; it is the study of a publisher’s programmatic stack to see which partner is able to provide the most, and best, demand relative to the supply publishers have available or that goes unsold. In practice, yield management requires a delicate balance of assessing workflows at a granular level to identify which partners give you the most bang for your buck. Publishers who have committed to yield management have a recipe for success that approaches market changes with data and analytics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most publishers stand to learn from these early yield adopters, especially as more changes to the industry are expected to roll out this year including SPO, identity &amp; privacy, and inventory quality. However, few publishers today are equipped to support the type of ongoing analysis needed to withstand these changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>SPO</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Publishers are no longer the only ones within the ecosystem looking to streamline their buying paths. Buyers are becoming more aware of the effect of supply paths, especially reselling, and are looking to maximize their buying power with only a few key partners, cutting out middlemen. It will be imperative that publishers work with SSPs that are in good standing with top DSPs and have the technical expertise to keep up with SPO optimizations from clients and DSPs, alike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through yield management, publishers can collect data on where demand is coming from to understand the value of each SSP in correlation with each DSP, and therefore buyer. SSPs who can assist with this analysis will be better suited to provide insights and potential adjustments to combat client shifts, leading to higher revenue and fill rates for the publishers and better delivery and win rates for clients &#8211; a win, win for all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Privacy &amp; Identity</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third-party cookie deprecation has been in discussions for years, but it won’t actually go into effect until the end of 2022.&nbsp; While competing solutions and initiatives are being introduced, debated and reimagined, publishers can begin to take action by taking a look at their own tech stack and proprietary data.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First-party data will be crucial to success when third-party cookies disappear across platforms. Leaning on yield management practices now can help publishers leverage their first-party data to identify which audiences a publisher currently has and will potentially have in the future — and mitigate risk. Until third-party cookie adjustments come into play, publishers can utilize their own data and overlay it with performance and brand data to lay the foundation for more strategic selling. These patterns can then be leveraged for matchmaking opportunities with buyers to access inventory via PMPs, audience packaging, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Inventory Quality</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inventory quality has always been touted as an important metric for publishers to make their inventory more distinct and valuable for buyers. However, metrics like viewability and CTR have conflicting impacts from one side of the exchange to the other, with demand believing higher quality must equate to higher yield, when in reality improving placements do not always equate to more revenue for the publisher and a better audience response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reducing “low-quality” placements based on viewability and CTR, alone, can come at a cost to publishers. Without disciplined experimentation, a core principle of Yield Management, publishers could see themselves out of meaningful revenue from remnant demand. Likewise, for high quality placements publishers could underestimate the potential return on investment of making minor adjustments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Check Your Tech</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With these imminent changes on the horizon, and others that are yet to be seen, publishers should focus on owning and understanding their partnerships and information. Going back to basics, and creating a framework built off of a methodical approach to data, will provide clarity to any challenges and changes that arise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h5>For more information on how to leverage Yield Management for a successful tomorrow, please join TripleLift, CafeMedia and California Times in a panel discussion, <a href=\"https://tripleliftevents.com/CheckYourTech/Bg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Check Your Tech,</em> on March 25th, 2021</a>.&nbsp;</h5>\n","title":"The Unsteady State: A Renewed Look Into The Longevity of Yield Management","uri":"/blog/the-unsteady-state-a-renewed-look-into-the-longevity-of-yield-management/","date":"March 09, 2021","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/22ced4069d1d425fb4bef68624c4bd3c/69209/Yield_Management_blog_1024x1024.jpg","srcSet":"/static/22ced4069d1d425fb4bef68624c4bd3c/e9e8b/Yield_Management_blog_1024x1024.jpg 250w,\n/static/22ced4069d1d425fb4bef68624c4bd3c/84742/Yield_Management_blog_1024x1024.jpg 500w,\n/static/22ced4069d1d425fb4bef68624c4bd3c/69209/Yield_Management_blog_1024x1024.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/22ced4069d1d425fb4bef68624c4bd3c/98dbc/Yield_Management_blog_1024x1024.avif 250w,\n/static/22ced4069d1d425fb4bef68624c4bd3c/92e1f/Yield_Management_blog_1024x1024.avif 500w,\n/static/22ced4069d1d425fb4bef68624c4bd3c/9b3e4/Yield_Management_blog_1024x1024.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/22ced4069d1d425fb4bef68624c4bd3c/0b151/Yield_Management_blog_1024x1024.webp 250w,\n/static/22ced4069d1d425fb4bef68624c4bd3c/33dd0/Yield_Management_blog_1024x1024.webp 500w,\n/static/22ced4069d1d425fb4bef68624c4bd3c/6429b/Yield_Management_blog_1024x1024.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDozMDkyMg==","excerpt":"<p>As the industry grapples with issues of brand safety, performance, and how both can scale, we sat down with Pete Erickson, Vice President of Publisher Development, to discuss TripleLift’s approach.

I help make sure we bring on supply, but the right kinds of supply, for our buy-side clients to run on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The terms “quality” and “scale” can mean different things. How do you think about them?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For agencies and brands that need to run campaigns, the first piece is that we need to make sure we have scale to meet their performance metrics. A platform that doesn’t have scale would mean buyers need to run their campaign longer than they want to, or just not meet their metrics. The fact that we have scale is important. The second piece is quality. We need to offer buyers the type of content and audience that they want to run their ads on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Just to really dig into this for a moment, there is this idea out there that buyers have to make a tradeoff between scale and quality. Is this still the case?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not so much anymore. Prior to 2014, there actually was a lot of lower quality supply on real-time bidding exchanges. At that time, buyers who wanted premium publishers had to reach out in the more traditional, direct way. The joke back then was that real time bidding was a race to the bottom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Quite a contrast from where things are now.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. TripleLift is a large global company and we’re working with publishers from the largest media companies in the world, definitely the comScore 100, all the way to mid- and long-tail publishers. And it’s vital to us that everything in our supply is brand safe, that everything is going to perform well and convert well for our buyers, across everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do you decide what’s a quality publisher?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do have automated systems, with all sorts of high-tech stuff running across the platforms, but you need humans to fine tune it. With any computer learning algorithm you have to run it, analyze it, tweak it, optimize, and so on. That’s part of the value we’re bringing to clients and publishers. In a lot of cases there are just common sense checks that folks on our team do, like going through a site, clicking through articles, and reading them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are you looking for when you decide to kick a publisher off the platform?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brand safety and performance issues. From a brand safety perspective, misinformation is something we have always been careful about not allowing onto our platforms.We need to be on top of whether a site is misleading people about, say, a vaccine. Our partnership with NewsGuard, a company that vets thousands of sites, has been super-valuable in helping us keep those sites off our platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And what kind of performance red flags are you looking for?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Viewability is a major one. We look at viewability up front to make sure every single publisher is meeting our standards. There are many others. Bounce rate, for example. If users land on a site, then leave immediately, that tells us something. Maybe a publisher is trying to pump new traffic from various sources that are themselves low quality. And we don’t want our advertisers wasting money on stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You’ve made the point that this process can actually benefit publishers.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit to publishers is that each of them is plugged into our platform with thousands of other publishers who meet our standards. That ends up attracting good brands, good agencies, and big campaigns. Our publishers know they’re going to be on the receiving end of those campaigns, and that when they perform really well, that means bigger budgets from buyers down the line.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Let’s touch on a related point, which is that you connect directly with all of your publishers, in the technical sense, which brings efficiencies and trust to buyers.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The analogy I like to make about directness is that if you’re buying a car, and you buy it from a private party, you’re going to get a better deal than if you go to a dealer, or someone who’s aggregating a bunch of listings from dealers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The buyer doesn’t pay the intermediary in that example.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. That’s how it works in programmatic as well. TripleLift is 100% direct in our integrations with publishers. So you avoid what we call the “tech tax,” where if you’re involving more companies in the re-selling of inventory, everybody is going to take their fee or slice of the pie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And of course with a less direct path, a brand can’t be sure of the ultimate environment where their ad appears.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a brand ends up where they don’t want to be, more often than not it’s because they bought through a non-direct supply path. That happens when a publisher works with an SSP that doesn’t have enough demand. So they sell to another SSP. As soon as you do that, you lose control. At TripleLift, we won’t allow another SSP to plug into us. We don’t think it’s good for publishers or buyers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It would seem daunting to forge direct relationships with so many publisher partners, but the roots of those actually go back to your native business.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At our core, we are a native platform. In our early days, there was a technical reason for our direct relationships, we needed to work directly with publishers to design the look and feel and size and location of ads. So we built our entire platform on those direct relationships.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we have direct relationships with 780 parent publishers encompassing 24,000+ sites and 2,200+ apps. Relationships we’ve built one-by-one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Thanks so much, Pete!</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5><a href=\"/go/we-go-beyond/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">See more on how TripleLift goes beyond to deliver scale, quality and service to ensure your campaign&#8217;s success.</a></h5>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","title":"The Advantage of Quality Scale","uri":"/blog/the-advantage-of-quality-scale/","date":"March 08, 2021","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/81750740e02be8f24d272bb3c2de29dd/8f3c3/WGB-advantagequalityscale-uberblog.png","srcSet":"/static/81750740e02be8f24d272bb3c2de29dd/5add7/WGB-advantagequalityscale-uberblog.png 250w,\n/static/81750740e02be8f24d272bb3c2de29dd/aef42/WGB-advantagequalityscale-uberblog.png 500w,\n/static/81750740e02be8f24d272bb3c2de29dd/8f3c3/WGB-advantagequalityscale-uberblog.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/81750740e02be8f24d272bb3c2de29dd/98dbc/WGB-advantagequalityscale-uberblog.avif 250w,\n/static/81750740e02be8f24d272bb3c2de29dd/92e1f/WGB-advantagequalityscale-uberblog.avif 500w,\n/static/81750740e02be8f24d272bb3c2de29dd/9b3e4/WGB-advantagequalityscale-uberblog.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/81750740e02be8f24d272bb3c2de29dd/0b151/WGB-advantagequalityscale-uberblog.webp 250w,\n/static/81750740e02be8f24d272bb3c2de29dd/33dd0/WGB-advantagequalityscale-uberblog.webp 500w,\n/static/81750740e02be8f24d272bb3c2de29dd/6429b/WGB-advantagequalityscale-uberblog.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDozMTI5OA==","excerpt":"<p>We are excited to announce that as of March 2021, TripleLift advertisers can apply Google’s Affinity and In-Market audience segments to their campaigns in Display &amp; Video 360 and leverage expansion tools across all devices at no additional cost.

What this means is that all apps will be required to obtain user permission to collect and share a user’s data upon download. The move from an opt-out to an opt-in standard marks a sea change for addressable advertising on Apple devices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have been working to prepare for this since Apple first announced plans for the privacy-change over a year ago. And while there are still many unknowns, we are committed to helping our partners navigate these changes and limit the impact on their business.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a look at what we know now, and what publishers can do to prepare for the changes ahead.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>What do we know about Apple’s privacy policy changes?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>In addition to giving users more control over their data by limiting the IDFA data available for attribution across mobile, Apple will provide a new attribution solution through its SKAdNetwork and App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>At the 2020 Apple Worldwide Developers conference in June, Apple announced changes to its App Store privacy guidelines.&nbsp;</li><li>In addition to this policy change, Apple also required publishers to adopt a new framework, App Tracking Transparency, introduced with iOS 14.&nbsp;</li><li>The most notable change announced is a new user permission requirement for IDFA collection, meaning users must opt-in to share their device’s advertising identifier for tracking purposes.<ul><li>As a refresher, IDFA provides a unique ID tag for devices to enable tracking, and therefore measurement.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When will Apple roll out the iOS 14 update?&nbsp;</strong><br>In September of 2020, Apple informed developers of a delay in that implementation.&nbsp;<br>The new privacy update to iOS 14 is expected this spring. The update could take place as early as March 2021.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What is SKAdNetwork? And, what do you need to know about how to support it?&nbsp;</strong><br>SKAdNetwork is a privacy-first framework developed by Apple to help marketers measure the success of their campaign by attributing mobile app installs on Apple devices. In the absence of IDFAs, Apple has provided the SKAdNetwork API as an attribution framework.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For publishers to ensure that they are able to support SKAdNetwork, <em><strong>make sure you are on the latest version of your advertising SDKs</strong></em> and confirm that they support the SKADNetwork OpenRTB signals. TripleLift will then indicate the relevant signals to demand partners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Update your app’s info.plist file</strong>:</em> Publishers should include the SKAdNetworkIDs of all DSPs to whom they want to sell to in their info.plist file. Please see all required TripleLift SKAdNetwork IDs <strong><a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.3lift.com/skadnetwork.json\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>SKAdNetwork ID Format:</em></strong> Apple’s requirement is that PList should be in lowercase form. Having a SKAdNetwork ID in uppercase can break tracking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What else can publishers do to prepare for these changes?&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>Begin testing now.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Publishers should determine how they are going to set up, test and manage their ATT prompts. Since a publisher only has one opportunity to prompt users to opt-in to sharing IDFA, it’s business critical for publishers’ to put their best foot forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does your Mobile Measurement Partner (MMP) have A/B testing data you can leverage to increase your opt-in rates?
