TripleLift is the world’s largest source of In-Feed inventory with premium placements that blend seamlessly with the look &amp; feel of publisher pages.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the key benefits of a direct integration:</p>\n<p><strong>More working media dollars.</strong><br />\nConsolidation in the programmatic supply chain allows new and existing buyers to maximize the value of their working media budgets. In addition to this, direct buyers have access to net-new publishers that weren’t previously available via intermediaries as well as larger audience pools across all publishers.</p>\n<p><strong>Trading workflow improvements.</strong><br />\nWith a direct integration, buyers can select ‘TripleLift’ as an exchange in the same place they select all other key partners on Display &amp; Video 360. Those looking to extend the reach of Social campaigns will reap the benefits of the direct integration beyond ROI — they now have the advantage of scale too. Buyers can repurpose their Social assets for Native programmatic and leverage Display &amp; Video 360 Native capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Better performance across the funnel.<br />\n</strong> We’ve seen positive increases in performance in moving to a direct integration, most notably win rate. Better win rate means more working media dollars at play, which clients have been thrilled about.</p>\n<p>For more information on how to access this inventory, reach out to <a href=\"mailto:dv360@triplelift.com\">dv360@triplelift.com</a></p>\n","title":"TripleLift Inventory Now Available Directly in Display & Video 360","uri":"/blog/inventory-available-display-video-360/","date":"April 29, 2020","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1d057a6faafb4dd508477a46e47e6cab/69209/042820-DV360-Blog3.jpg","srcSet":"/static/1d057a6faafb4dd508477a46e47e6cab/e9e8b/042820-DV360-Blog3.jpg 250w,\n/static/1d057a6faafb4dd508477a46e47e6cab/84742/042820-DV360-Blog3.jpg 500w,\n/static/1d057a6faafb4dd508477a46e47e6cab/69209/042820-DV360-Blog3.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/1d057a6faafb4dd508477a46e47e6cab/98dbc/042820-DV360-Blog3.avif 250w,\n/static/1d057a6faafb4dd508477a46e47e6cab/92e1f/042820-DV360-Blog3.avif 500w,\n/static/1d057a6faafb4dd508477a46e47e6cab/9b3e4/042820-DV360-Blog3.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/1d057a6faafb4dd508477a46e47e6cab/0b151/042820-DV360-Blog3.webp 250w,\n/static/1d057a6faafb4dd508477a46e47e6cab/33dd0/042820-DV360-Blog3.webp 500w,\n/static/1d057a6faafb4dd508477a46e47e6cab/6429b/042820-DV360-Blog3.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/ways-our-world-will-change-after-coronavirus/","title":"14 Ways Our World Will Change After Coronavirus"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/value-digital-storytelling/","title":"The Value of Digital Storytelling During A Time of Disruption "}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoyNTA4NA==","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoyNTA5Mw==","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoyNDkwNQ=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
