Whether that is scrolling on a website or in a mobile app, watching online video or viewing a show on connected TV, video is everywhere and so are the advertising opportunities. To help brands and advertisers reach audiences wherever they are watching, TripleLift is launching a full funnel suite of video solutions for online video and connected TV. The suite of solutions includes ad formats and experiences for the three ways audiences consume video content: In-Feed, In-Break and In-Show.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://new.triplelift.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Website-Blog-article-image-800x300-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-31758\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Jacqueline Quantrell, TripleLift’s Chief Revenue Officer, reflects on the next era of digital advertising: “As video consumption habits evolve and time spent across all devices remains on the rise, it is increasingly important for video solutions to reflect these changes. As a top three programmatic video supply partner<sup>1</sup> with over 25,000 publisher partners across online video and connected TV, and the only Supply Side Partner to offer a full funnel portfolio of video solutions, TripleLift is uniquely positioned to help advertisers achieve their performance goals.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With TripleLift In-Feed video formats, advertisers can reach audiences directly within a feed of content. These ad units match the unique look and feel of each publisher site and offer customized branding that can drive up to 9X the purchase intent compared to a standard digital video ad.<sup>2</sup></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For advertisers looking to drive both awareness and consideration among target audiences, TripleLift’s video portfolio includes In-Break formats for online video and connected TV including In-Stream Video and Connected TV Spots.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, currently in a private beta, TripleLift is pioneering new programmatic In-Show ad formats that are organic, integrated and less interruptive than traditional television advertising.&nbsp; TripleLift In-Show ad formats include CTV Integrated Ad Experiences: Dynamic Overlays, Split Screen Units, and Brand Integrations, all informed by machine learning technology and a creative team of integrated marketers, and all delivered dynamically via automation. TripleLift’s integrated ad experiences effectively deliver upper funnel metrics including increased engagement<sup>3</sup> and brand awareness.<sup>4</sup><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://new.triplelift.com/video\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more here about how TripeLift’s video portfolio can help you achieve your KPIs</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><sup>1</sup> DV360, Feb 2021 Inventory Availability Report</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><sup>2</sup> TripleLift, Kantar MWB Norms: Consumables, Video Format: n=457 campaigns</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><sup>3</sup> <em>TripleLift, MediaScience In-Show Integrations Study 2021</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><sup>4</sup><em>TripleLift, Millward Brown Brand Lift, Video Format Study 2021</em></p>\n","title":"TripleLift Ushers in Next Era of Digital Video Advertising with Full-Funnel, Suite of Video Solutions","uri":"/blog/triplelift-ushers-in-next-era-of-digital-video-advertising-with-full-funnel-suite-of-video-solutions/","date":"May 07, 2021","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNDI=","name":"Native Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/8f3c3/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.png","srcSet":"/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/5add7/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.png 250w,\n/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/aef42/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.png 500w,\n/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/8f3c3/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/98dbc/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.avif 250w,\n/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/92e1f/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.avif 500w,\n/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/9b3e4/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/0b151/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.webp 250w,\n/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/33dd0/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.webp 500w,\n/static/b58659cfd62a58dc85c7819dde942d2d/6429b/Website-Blog-Thumbnail-1024x1024_2-2.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":null,"next":{"uri":"/blog/a-nickels-worth-of-freestar-advice-insights-from-ceo-kurt-donnell-part2/","title":"Part 2 : A Nickel’s Worth of Freestar Advice, Insights from CEO Kurt Donnell"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozMTc4Nw==","previousPostId":null,"nextPostId":"cG9zdDozMTU1Mw=="}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
