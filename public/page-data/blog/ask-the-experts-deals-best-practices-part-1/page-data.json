We know that deals work well. We’ve seen great performance across our deals for Branded Video, Native, and <a href=\"/static/0e50123a271cb51113f2f1cc3864dd19/Display_Evergreen-Deals_OneSheet_Demand_2020.pdf\">now Direct Display</a>. But for all the great performance we’ve seen, we’ve also seen confusion about when to activate a deal or how to set up campaigns in a way that doesn’t negatively impact deal spend.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help prepare buyers for this move towards the future of deal spend, we’ve created a two part series where we’ve interviewed two rising stars at TripleLift: Thomas Yi, Director of Campaign Management and Benazir Shareef, Senior Partner Manager. Today’s installment features Thomas Yi, who is an expert on all things campaign management and what it takes to knock campaign KPIs out of the park.</span></p>\n<h5><a href=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/Thomas-Yi.jpg\"><span class=\"alignnone wp-image-4740 size-thumbnail inline-gatsby-image-wrapper gatsby-image-wrapper\" style=\"position:relative;overflow:hidden;max-width:100%;width:150px\" data-reactroot=\"\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"width:100%;padding-bottom:100%\"></span><img aria-hidden=\"true\" src=\"data:image/jpeg;base64,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\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:0;transition-delay:500ms\"/><picture><source srcSet=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/82196/Thomas-Yi.jpg 38w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/ab49a/Thomas-Yi.jpg 75w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/4934c/Thomas-Yi.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\"/><img sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" srcSet=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/82196/Thomas-Yi.jpg 38w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/ab49a/Thomas-Yi.jpg 75w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/4934c/Thomas-Yi.jpg 150w\" src=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/4934c/Thomas-Yi.jpg\" alt=\"\" loading=\"eager\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center;opacity:1;transition:opacity 500ms\"/></picture><noscript><picture><source srcset=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/82196/Thomas-Yi.jpg 38w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/ab49a/Thomas-Yi.jpg 75w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/4934c/Thomas-Yi.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /><img loading=\"eager\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" srcset=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/82196/Thomas-Yi.jpg 38w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/ab49a/Thomas-Yi.jpg 75w,\n/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/4934c/Thomas-Yi.jpg 150w\" src=\"/static/0055aa6fb04ea7ee6707b114ba00354f/4934c/Thomas-Yi.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;opacity:1;width:100%;height:100%;object-fit:cover;object-position:center\"/></picture></noscript></span></a> Thomas Yi, Director of Campaign Management, TripleLift</h5>\n<blockquote><p>“From knowledge sharing initiatives, to updated collateral and everything in between, Campaign Managers are always seeking ways to improve efficiencies and processes at TripleLift.”</p></blockquote>\n<p><b>The Campaign Management team is tasked with making sure deals are running smoothly and delivering on KPIs. What’s a typical day in the life of a campaign manager like?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas: The campaign management team prides itself on being able to wear many hats. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Generally speaking, Campaign Managers will kick their day off with an organizational and housekeeping routine. Once finished with the typical housekeeping items like checking on emails, investigating ticket requests, and doign creative audit, Campaign Managers will jump into a range of requests: from generating tags and providing demo links for clients, to building RFP plans and decks, setting up campaigns, and investigating blockers and bugs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><b>Campaign Management recently packaged up inventory for our Evergreen Deals for Direct Display launch. Can you tell us a little about how those packages are created? What goes into that process?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas: Through Triplelift’s partnership with IAS and MOAT we are able to measure the viewability of every placement on the Triplelift exchange. With this data we create inventory packages of placements that meet certain viewability criteria. After packaging this inventory to meet 50/60/70 percent viewability needs, we create Evergreen deal ids for each DSP integrated with Tripelift that make it easy for our clients and brands to target this premium inventory through any platform they use to execute their digital buys.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Afterwards, we are consistently evaluating and refreshing the placements in each package on an ongoing basis.</span></p>\n<p><b>Campaign Management are troubleshooting experts when it comes to deals. What’s some practical advice you’d like our clients to know when running a campaign on deals?</b></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thomas: Triplelift is proud of the fact that we are able to offer many different deal types across a wide range of our offerings. In the interest of time I will focus on best practices for Native performance deals.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong>Best Practices:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set-up new deals for each unique campaign you plan to run. This ensures maximum performance as Triplelift will be able to send you custom inventory based on&nbsp; the needs of each individual campaign. This also allows for your Triplelift Partner Manager to assist with monitoring performance for any given campaign and make adjustments to inventory based on the performance data they are seeing on our end,</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure to include the </span><b>full </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">deal name when setting them up in your DSP. Triplelift deals will always start with “tlx” and be followed by 5 or 6 digits (tlx-54356).&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When setting up a seat deal, make sure to send over accurate DSP seat information to your Triplelift Partner Manager. If you are unsure of where to find your seat information within your DSP, reach-out to your DSP rep or dedicated Triplelift Partner Manager for assistance. t.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t set a floor. Triplelift performance deals do not have floors on them. When setting up deals in your DSP please make sure to set a $0.00 floor (or $0.01 in the case your DSP does not allow for $0.00)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Communicate the below so that your Partner Managers can help optimize keeping in mind the variables that might affect your campaign:</span>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;Accurate budgets and </span><b>all</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> targeting, audience, brand safety and/or viewability levers that are enabled on the campaign before going live.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">KPIs and benchmarks for success for your campaigns.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Performance reporting (viewability, conversion, etc.)</span></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We thank Thomas for the expertise his team brings to the table.
