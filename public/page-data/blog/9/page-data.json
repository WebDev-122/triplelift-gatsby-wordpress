There is tremendous excitement in advertising to treat it like digital media, with all its amazing tech, data and precision.</p>\n<div class=\"postup-adweek-wall-section\">\n<p>I worry this excitement is causing too many of us to miss a critical point, though. The shift from linear TV to streaming is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/a-digital-revolution-might-kickstart-a-resurgence-of-tv-advertising/\">nothing short of revolutionary,</a>&nbsp;and the advertising that supports this content warrants a revolution of its own.</p>\n<p>That revolution won’t happen by simply making TV ads more targeted or addressable. As TV goes over the top, it’s time to rethink the basics of TV advertising: how and when ads get delivered and how much control users have over that experience. Postponing this conversation means that by the time the industry gets targeted TV advertising sorted out, there won’t be enough people left watching commercial television.</p>\n<p>Think for a moment about how much time you spend streaming these days versus watching live TV. What about your kids? It’s become standard for multiple generations to watch television with a minimal amount of traditional ad spots.</p>\n<p>Nearly every major Netflix or Amazon original series features an abundance of product placements and brand integrations. Consumers don’t object to them because they don’t look and feel like ads, at least not in the way most people think of traditional TV ads. This is a win for brands that get to connect with non-traditional audiences. And yet,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/on-the-adweek-podcast-the-global-tv-industry-takes-on-netflix/\">Netflix never misses a chance</a>&nbsp;to talk about the fact that we’ll never see ads on the service. That’s because the company understands that our collective tolerance for interruptive TV advertising is waning. But by and large, the advertising industry continues to ignore this reality.</p>\n<p>OTT advertising requires an entirely new ad approach. Here are five ways that revolution can play out.</p>\n<h5><strong>Ads will use lifetime value to measure success</strong></h5>\n<p>There is an intuition in entertainment that listening to the consumer is the winning business model. Many companies speculate that fewer, better ads that put the consumer first lead to more completed streams, higher pricing and greater revenues. Some have proven it. The best manifestation of this is finding an optimal mix of ads, which may differ by viewer, content and ad experience, taking into account the lifetime value of a viewer over months or years to refine what that optimal mix should be.</p>\n<h5><strong>Ads will get closer to the content experience</strong></h5>\n<p>We’ve already seen this as more brands ink product placement deals with ad-free streaming services. Netflix brought in an estimated $15 million in product placement alone for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/more-than-26-million-us-viewers-watched-part-of-stranger-things-season-3-in-its-first-4-days/\">Stranger Things Season 3,</a>&nbsp;including a high-profile deal with Coca-Cola. Placement deals are gaining momentum as more consumers cut the cord.</p>\n<h5><strong>We’ll have to find new creative ways to share the screen</strong></h5>\n<p>If you’ve watched broadcasts of Premier League soccer and PGA tournaments, you’ve experienced promotions that creatively share the screen and complement the content, often during team huddles or when a manager makes a visit to the mound. Expect more experimentation like this.</p>\n<h5><strong>The industry will have to finally marry content and commerce</strong></h5>\n<p>In the 1990s, there was an oft-repeated promise at advertising conferences that you’d soon be able to “buy Ross’ shirt” on Friends. The industry has been talking about this prospect for decades, but neither technology nor consumers were ready for that. The current generation of viewers, however, expects their content to be active and participatory, and they have the payment mechanisms built into their phones and TVs to facilitate quick purchases. It’s time to develop creative ways to blend streaming and shopping, which may start at the series conception stage.</p>\n<h5><strong>Brands may unlock shows</strong></h5>\n<p>There’s an overwhelming amount of amazing content available right now and a myriad number of streaming options. Let’s say you’re not sure you want to commit to paying for CBS Access, for example. Maybe a brand like GM could enable you to watch an episode or a season of the new Star Trek series in exchange for viewing ads or sharing some basic information? Brands serving as gatekeepers to new content may give them a better path to earning attention from their target audiences.</p>\n<p>While we don’t know the full potential of OTT advertising, we’re starting to see creative experimentation across the industry, like new ads that display on Hulu and AT&amp;T that appear when a viewer pauses a series. And we’ll continue to see more. One thing we do know is that the answers to TV’s ad future surely won’t be found in the past. Addressable TV is great, but it won’t be enough if we don’t recognize that everything about TV is changing and that our ads need to keep pace.</p>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<article id=\"post-1072559\" class=\"main-content post-1072559 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-streaming-ott category-voice nodequeue-single-item-to-feature vertical-tv-video contributor-ari-lewine content-hero\" data-url=\"https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/rethinking-and-predicting-the-future-of-tv-advertising/\" data-id=\"1072559\" data-tags=\"[&quot;streaming-ott&quot;,&quot;voice&quot;,&quot;tv-video&quot;]\" data-zone=\"tv-video\" data-authors=\"ari-lewine\" data-date=\"2019-10-07 12:00\" data-featured=\"voice\" data-bitlyurl=\"https://adweek.it/31KVSbP\" data-excerpt=\"Everything is changing, and ads need to keep up.\" data-title=\"Rethinking and Predicting the Future of TV Advertising\" data-categories=\"streaming-ott, voice\" data-popup=\"\" data-ads=\"Yes\" data-company=\"[]\" data-outstream=\"yes\" data-auth=\"\">\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<div class=\"post-text\">\n<div class=\"footer-contributors\">\n<div class=\"contributor\">\n<div class=\"con-details \">\n<div class=\"widget-area sticky-container\"><em>By Ari Lewine, Co-Founder and Chief Strategy Officer of TripleLift.</em> <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/tv-video/rethinking-and-predicting-the-future-of-tv-advertising/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>See the featured article on Adweek.</em></a></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</article>\n<aside id=\"sidebar\" class=\"sidebar\"></aside>\n","title":"Rethinking and Predicting the Future of TV Advertising","uri":"/blog/rethinking-predicting-future-television-ads/","date":"October 10, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyNTA=","name":"Adweek"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxOTQ=","name":"OTT"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMDc=","name":"OTT advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTozNDY=","name":"Television Ads"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTozNTM=","name":"TV advertising"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5c9efaff58f58565e65f0e436a1c6140/69209/101019_RethinkingFutureofTV1500x1500.jpg","srcSet":"/static/5c9efaff58f58565e65f0e436a1c6140/e9e8b/101019_RethinkingFutureofTV1500x1500.jpg 250w,\n/static/5c9efaff58f58565e65f0e436a1c6140/84742/101019_RethinkingFutureofTV1500x1500.jpg 500w,\n/static/5c9efaff58f58565e65f0e436a1c6140/69209/101019_RethinkingFutureofTV1500x1500.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5c9efaff58f58565e65f0e436a1c6140/98dbc/101019_RethinkingFutureofTV1500x1500.avif 250w,\n/static/5c9efaff58f58565e65f0e436a1c6140/92e1f/101019_RethinkingFutureofTV1500x1500.avif 500w,\n/static/5c9efaff58f58565e65f0e436a1c6140/9b3e4/101019_RethinkingFutureofTV1500x1500.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/5c9efaff58f58565e65f0e436a1c6140/0b151/101019_RethinkingFutureofTV1500x1500.webp 250w,\n/static/5c9efaff58f58565e65f0e436a1c6140/33dd0/101019_RethinkingFutureofTV1500x1500.webp 500w,\n/static/5c9efaff58f58565e65f0e436a1c6140/6429b/101019_RethinkingFutureofTV1500x1500.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDo0Mzc0","excerpt":"<p>For the third year in a row, TripleLift was named to Inc. 5000’s Annual List of America’s Fastest-Growing Private Companies.

Now, we speak with the three co-founders,<b> CEO Eric Berry, Chief Strategy Officer Ari Lewine, and President Shaun Zacharia</b>, to hear what has helped make them successful and what’s next for the future of the company.</p>\n<h6><b>What does it mean for TripleLift to be honored for the third time on the Inc. 5000?</b></h6>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Eric</b>: This is an incredible honor. Over the past eight years, we&#8217;ve built a company with truly incredible people whose dedication, passion, and drive have enabled us to really reach this level of growth across the world. Having been on the list for three consecutive years, while being profitable, and now while having revenue significantly in excess of $100 million is, more than anything, a statement that the entire company is operating at such a high level, that we have such a tremendous team that is so capable and can bring on such great people. I&#8217;m honored to be a part of this great organization.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Ari</b>: I think its tremendous validation that you can both focus on user-friendly advertising <i>and </i>build a successful business simultaneously.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><b>Shaun</b>: Getting recognized as one of America&#8217;s fastest-growing companies is a meaningful milestone. Doing so three times in a row with an accelerating growth rate speaks to the promise of our vision to invent, power, and scale ads that <i>earn</i> consumer attention.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h6><b>What major challenges did you face to get to this point, and how did you pivot to make sure to keep your growth trajectory so strong?</b></h6>\n<blockquote><p><b>Eric</b>: TripleLift was built on the idea that great user experience should be the foundation of any advertising experience. But we simply didn&#8217;t know the answer about how to make this simple, scalable and effective. We had to iterate nearly a dozen times to get the right mix, the right technology, and the right commercialization. And even then, we have to keep thinking about how to disrupt our business — which in turn has created innumerable more opportunities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Ari</b>: Many have said that in order for advertising to be effective, it needs to stand out and do something to grab someone&#8217;s attention. I think the major challenge for us has been balancing earning consumer attention while driving significantly better performance for marketers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Shaun</b>: Building a two-sided marketplace from scratch is generally regarded as one of the more difficult things a company can do, and doing so with an offering that’s unprecedented in market only makes the endeavor that much harder to pull off. While we&#8217;ve been quick to embrace and drive change, our perseverance and overall commitment to doing the hard work associated with delivering against our mission has been a driving force behind our success. What’s particularly exciting is that once a two-sided marketplace gets going, it benefits from powerful network effects that result in significantly greater value to customers, allowing us to further our mission.</p></blockquote>\n<h6><b>AdExchanger </b><a href=\"https://adexchanger.com/ad-exchange-news/inc-revenue-survey-illustrates-marked-slowdown-for-ad-tech/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><b>recently noted</b></a><b> that there is a slowdown in revenue growth across ad tech, and that TripleLift was one of only three ad tech companies included on Inc. 5000 to achieve revenue over $100 million dollars in 2018. To what do you attribute the success TripleLift had over the last year?</b></h6>\n<blockquote><p><b>Eric</b>: TripleLift is built around an idea and not a product. We&#8217;re built around the notion that advertising should be part of a great user experience instead of forcing a specific type of user experience. We&#8217;ve been really thoughtful about how to expand that idea into all the different channels where people consume content, and all the different ways people consume content.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Ari</b>: In general, the bar is being raised in ad tech. There’s more emphasis on solving fraud, running in brand safe environments, and industry initiatives like ads.txt. It tends to be that as the industry continues to improve and raise the bar of quality, companies who have quality as a core focus tend to thrive.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Shaun</b>: As we approach the later stages of the innovation cycle that brought us highly disruptive technologies such as real-time bidding and programmatic advertising, the fastest-growing companies will be those who pioneer net new technologies and markets beyond the application of programmatic advertising to increasingly mature markets such as display and video.</p></blockquote>\n<h6><b>How will TripleLift continue to grow over the next year?</b></h6>\n<blockquote><p><b>Eric</b>: TripleLift&#8217;s mission is inventing, powering, and scaling ads that earn consumer attention wherever people consume content. We invest aggressively in R&amp;D to think about the best monetization opportunities to compliment user experiences and to effectively commercialize them across the various markets in which we operate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Ari</b>: We’re focused on continuing to drive user-friendly ad experiences across new areas like TV and branded content.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Shaun</b>: In addition to capitalizing on our pole position within one of the single-fastest growing market segments within digital advertising, TripleLift is pioneering new and exciting OTT ad experiences beyond the traditional ad break, such as product placement and other brand integrations that align with consumer preferences and can be activated programmatically. As the streaming wars kick off between Netflix, Amazon, Disney, AT&amp;T, Comcast, Apple, and others, our solutions have the potential to transform the $100B television advertising industry.</p></blockquote>\n<h6><b>What advice do you have for early stage start-up founders?</b></h6>\n<blockquote><p><b>Eric</b>: It&#8217;s always important to understand how the product that you&#8217;re building fits into a large idea — and how you plan to effectively build a company around that idea.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Ari</b>: Ask customers, or prospective customers, for feedback every day.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Shaun</b>: Never stop investing in the development of your mission, strategy, and values.</p></blockquote>\n<h6><b>If you could do it all over again what if anything would you do differently?</b></h6>\n<blockquote><p><b>Eric</b>: We&#8217;ve only raised $16.5 million. If anything, I would try to have raised less.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Ari</b>: I prefer to think about, and live in, the current moment.

Innovations will take shape in a variety of formats, such as in-action six, overlay, brand insertion, and production insertion. TripleLift’s approach to advanced advertising hopes to balance the varied interests of content creators, programmers and brands.</p>\n<p>At TripleLift, Shields will focus on creating a scalable, liquid marketplace for brand integrations. This includes developing the technology that allows for seamless integration of brands into television content, helping networks and streaming services build scalable businesses from brand integrations, and working with show creators to find opportunities for brand and product insertions that enhance storytelling.</p>\n<p>In his previous role as Senior Vice President, Sales Strategy and Business Development for Fox Networks Group, Shields was part of a team that successfully experimented with audience-first ad products, and was instrumentally involved in developing in-action, integrated ads, new formats and pricing models, and lowering ad loads across the Fox portfolio.

In a first price auction, bidders are able to more accurately model their spend, since there is no difference between the bid and win price.</p>\n<p>Google primed the market for this switch when it announced Google Ad Manager’s move to first price in March 2019 — paving the way for first price auctions to become the new industry standard.</p>\n<h4>How does this benefit TripleLift partners?</h4>\n<p>Both buyers and publishers will gain increased visibility into the true market value of an impression and market rates will begin to normalize as historical data is used to set the most appropriate bid price.</p>\n<p>For buyers, TripleLift’s algorithm will ensure that buyers pay the most optimal price for inventory that is best suited to deliver against the established campaign goals. Increased transparency will position publishers to more effectively gauge the true value of their inventory and manage pricing strategies.</p>\n<p>If you’d like to learn how first price auctions fit within your advertising strategy, contact your TripleLift representative.</p>\n","title":"TripleLift Moves to First Price Auctions","uri":"/blog/triplelift-exchange-first-price-auction/","date":"August 07, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybToxNzc=","name":"Announcement"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyODk=","name":"First Price Auction"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTozNTE=","name":"TripleLift Exchange"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/64c18df1d3e308de87b0580f14e92a01/69209/080719_FirstPriceAuction-1500x1500.jpg","srcSet":"/static/64c18df1d3e308de87b0580f14e92a01/e9e8b/080719_FirstPriceAuction-1500x1500.jpg 250w,\n/static/64c18df1d3e308de87b0580f14e92a01/84742/080719_FirstPriceAuction-1500x1500.jpg 500w,\n/static/64c18df1d3e308de87b0580f14e92a01/69209/080719_FirstPriceAuction-1500x1500.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/64c18df1d3e308de87b0580f14e92a01/98dbc/080719_FirstPriceAuction-1500x1500.avif 250w,\n/static/64c18df1d3e308de87b0580f14e92a01/92e1f/080719_FirstPriceAuction-1500x1500.avif 500w,\n/static/64c18df1d3e308de87b0580f14e92a01/9b3e4/080719_FirstPriceAuction-1500x1500.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/64c18df1d3e308de87b0580f14e92a01/0b151/080719_FirstPriceAuction-1500x1500.webp 250w,\n/static/64c18df1d3e308de87b0580f14e92a01/33dd0/080719_FirstPriceAuction-1500x1500.webp 500w,\n/static/64c18df1d3e308de87b0580f14e92a01/6429b/080719_FirstPriceAuction-1500x1500.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDo0MzE2","excerpt":"<p>On July 9, 2019, TripleLift &amp; MillerCoors co-hosted a State of Programmatic Video Breakfast event in Chicago to explore the ever-evolving video advertising landscape.

A refined list of partners will help streamline efficient communication from brand strategy, media planning and activation.</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>How has the agency model evolved as programmatic continues to become the way that all media is transacted?</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As all media channels converge from traditional platforms to programmatic, the most important task will always be coordination. Agency teams will continue to be at the center of this process and will be vital in leading this coordination between clients and ad tech partners.</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>How has the way brands think about the new video ecosystem changed now that OTT, CTV and Pre-roll converge?&nbsp;</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A key first step is for an organization to level set internally and ensure all teams are using the same vocabulary when defining video. From there, it is important to create best practices that align with key video success metrics (CPCV, VCR, Viewability etc.). Lastly, develop an approach where each video channel is aligned with specific brands, based on how well it can achieve specific KPIs that include both online and offline metrics.</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>What are the capabilities and challenges of OTT inventory as it stands today?</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main challenge advertisers face today is the amount of OTT players in the space. That’s a good thing because it means it’s working and worth your ad spend. However, the drawback is the amount of time that goes into testing and learning what drives best performance, which inventory has the most scale, and available targeting capabilities. Once those capabilities are more defined, it will be a clearer process from start to finish. Our industry will get there, because the consumers are already there. It will just take time, so patience is key.</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>How is creative development being refined today now that there are new video inventory sources available outside of traditional TV ads?</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important for the creative to be designed specifically for the media channel it will be running on. For instance, a 30-second or 15-second TV or pre-roll spot will not have the same impact in environments that lend themselves to streaming long-form content in the OTT space. At the same time, in environments where earning consumer attention needs to be quick and precise, a 6-second video ad could perform best on a mobile device.</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>What is one of the most important tactics for Ad Tech partners to consider when working with brands in the programmatic video world?</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always remember that brands take time to develop a thoughtful, cohesive strategy and tech stack where all elements are supposed to work together through a specific process. Ad Tech partners that can seamlessly integrate with a client’s existing DSP or DMP partners will have a key advantage in the space. This approach only allows for more opportunities to test, learn and develop best practices.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>What is on the rise for 2020 that marketers should be focused on?</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will be imperative for advertisers to learn how to identify opportunities that can help them scale campaigns effectively beyond the walled gardens. To do this, it will be incredibly important to diversify your media spend while also ensuring high-quality inventory sources are being included in your media strategy to drive efficiencies.</span></p>\n","title":"State of Programmatic Video: Tactical Advice for Advertisers from TripleLift & MillerCoors ","uri":"/blog/state-programmatic-video-advertising-triplelift-millercoors/","date":"July 29, 2019","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToyMjM=","name":"Branded Video"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxNzE=","name":"Outstream"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxOTU=","name":"Video Advertising"}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/69209/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/e9e8b/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.jpg 250w,\n/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/84742/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.jpg 500w,\n/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/69209/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.jpg 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/98dbc/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.avif 250w,\n/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/92e1f/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.avif 500w,\n/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/9b3e4/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.avif 1000w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/0b151/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.webp 250w,\n/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/33dd0/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.webp 500w,\n/static/ea6d4cf5ec4a9e08611ee7b924f6a552/6429b/072919_StateofProgTLMMillerCoorsVideo-1500x1500.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1000px) 1000px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":1000}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDo0Mjkz","excerpt":"<p>Video ads face a higher engagement hurdle.

Where other ads may only need a quick scan to be effective, video ads rely on true engagement with the video’s story in order to drive brand recall or action. The first step is actually getting a video ad to be seen on the page. Even if a video ad unit meets a viewability KPI, if the unit doesn’t drive meaningful engagement, it can result in inefficient media spend.</p>\n<p>So how can advertisers optimize their video ads to not only be seen, but to be watched in full and convert to a sale?</p>\n<p>TripleLift recently leveraged an eye tracking study through <strong><a href=\"https://www.sticky.ai/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Sticky</a></strong> to test what effectively drives a user’s eye to a video ad and what keeps them there longer. In this study, respondents were given a series of articles to read, but were not instructed to pay attention to any special elements. The articles consisted of a mixture of traditional outstream video ads and TripleLift’s own <a href=\"/formats/#branded-vid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Branded Video</a> ad format. Through the use of eye tracking technology, we tracked where respondents eyes naturally navigated across the page and for how long. Below are the findings.</p>\n<h3><b>Design and branding drastically impact whether a user sees a video ad on the page.</b></h3>\n<p>In the eye tracking study results below, the <b>heatmap represents a calculation of the number of eyes on a specific location on the page combined with the time those eyes spent on that location</b>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Darker areas are the highly concentrated views</li>\n<li>Lighter areas represent content that was viewed less</li>\n</ul>\n<p><b>Traditional outstream video ads</b> are designed to interrupt a user’s attention, by either displacing the content on the page or delaying the start of content the user wants to engage with.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blog-interior1-edit.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\"></p>\n<p>Despite the fact that these ads scream for attention, users have come to know and anticipate this design as disruptive — and have subsequently become accustomed to ignoring these types of ads entirely. In the heatmap below, the video ad and area surrounding the video lack colored shading.</p>\n<blockquote><p>That’s because in our study, <b>less than half of respondents stopped to look at those areas of the page.</b></p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blog-interior2.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4295 size-large\" src=\"https://triplelift.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/blog-interior2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Eye Tracking Study Reveals the Video Ads That Actually Get Viewed &amp; Why\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\"></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Design</b>: Even though the video ad was served mid-content, the design doesn’t fit the other content on the page. The ad is smaller than the width of the content, signaling to the user that it’s likely an interruption to their reading.</li>\n<li><b>Branding</b>: At a quick glance, can you name the brand or the product? Most users could not.

Instead of offering a naturally engaging experience, the industry has convinced itself that relying on forced views is working.</p>\n<p>But really, it alienates people — and the industry knows it. There’s ample evidence to show that video engagement and brand recall are suffering due to ineffective video ads. Ari also reminds us that those in the advertising industry are also consumers. If advertisers find an ad annoying, so will their audiences. So, why do ineffective ads persist? Ari believes it’s due to cognitive dissonance — the act of knowing one thing and feeling or doing another. In this video, Ari unpacks why humans act against their own knowledge, and introduces ways to fix that with a new business model that centers people.
