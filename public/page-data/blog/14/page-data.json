He likes privacy regulations. Honestly.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you park the fear, uncertainty and doubt surrounding GDPR for a moment or two, and simply try to imagine what is actually going to happen post May 25th &#8211; it&#8217;s an interesting exercise in value exchange.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Firstly, let&#8217;s imagine a world where digital advertising inventory splits into two camps  &#8211; Consentworld and the Land of Non Consent. In today’s piece we will focus on the former.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Consentworld, the end user has agreed to allow their personal data to be used by players in the advertising ecosystem. That consent will have been gathered by a publisher. But it’s unlikely to be a completely seamless universal consent at the browser level, it will be publisher, or publisher group specific.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And the user will be asked to provide consent as they move from site to site, and as cookies expire, or they change browser. The IAB predicts this may diminish over time, perhaps not.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So ask yourself this question: Which publishers would you </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actually</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> give your consent to if it was asked for tomorrow?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ignore how many (few) times recently you clicked “Continue” under the e-privacy cookie ribbons. These were designed to be non-obtrusive, and you may never have agreed at all, because you didn’t </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">actually</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> need to. But the new generation of GDPR consent workflows will need to be a lot more visible, perhaps even mandatory &#8211; because the publishers will need your explicit consent. Their businesses may depend on it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So again, which publishers would you actually say yes to today?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are like me &#8211; and that&#8217;s consumer John, not ad exec John &#8211; then that list is potentially reasonably small. It will be based on a series of long-developed relationships between the publisher and me over the course of my consumption. The longer that relationship has existed, the more likely I am to say “Yes”.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d probably say “Yes&#8221; to some publishers and “No” to others &#8211; for reasons I can’t really explain. It would be an instinctive reaction aimed at removing the offending question from my content consumption as quickly as possible and based on my association with that brand.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course there will be some people that I will take great delight in saying “No&#8221; too. Probably companies that turned me down for a job when I was breaking into journalism, or publishers that are using one of my competitor’s products today rather than mine. Naturally, I will immediately change my consent settings if they RFP us for future business&#8230;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are someone who has installed an Ad Blocker, then you have to imagine you are a straight &#8220;No&#8221; every time. You’ll probably even develop Consent Blocker plug ins to stop all those annoying consent boxes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have zero emotional attachment to the publisher brand &#8211; maybe you bounced there from a social media share &#8211; then you are probably going to lean towards a &#8220;No”, depending on how badly you need to see that cat video. The consent box becomes a clear roadblock between you and the content and with no value exchange, you’re going to bounce off the page.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you’ve said “Yes” in the past, but get irritated by some sort of aggressive retargeting, or an abundance of obtrusive or annoying ads on a page then you may even go looking for a way to retract that “Yes&#8221; and turn it into a “No&#8221;. Under GDPR rules, publishers have to make it as easy to remove the consent as it was to provide it, even potentially down to the granularity of a third-party processor or controller.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So take a look in your browser history right now, review the last ten distinct publishers that you visited and ask yourself the question would you happily provide consent to those publishers to run behavioral advertising using your personal data?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are mine: Ad Age, LinkedIn, Google, Daily Gazette, Healthy Way, Metro, Guardian, Facebook, Telegraph, ChefTalk.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Telegraph, Guardian and Metro are all current customers so naturally I would say “Yes” to them &#8211; it seems you can’t split consumer John from ad tech John.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’d say “No” to Google and Facebook for the same reason that I go out of my way not to click on a Search or Social ad if I can help it. They have enough money, they don’t need my click. That’s not a rational decision of course, more like jealousy at all of the advertiser spend the duopoly captures.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I have less personal affinity with the other publisher brands, particularly those that I discovered by descending down a social media rabbit hole and so it would be a harder decision, I’d probably have to think for a minute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn is an interesting one. I love LinkedIn, I think it is an incredibly valuable business tool, but I’m also a Premium subscriber. They already get a reasonably nice sum of money from me each year. It always feels like quite a large subscription price when it comes around to paying it. So would I allow them to squeeze yet more ‘value’ out of me if given the choice? That’s a close call, and I will wait until my next year’s subscription fee comes around before I tell anyone my decision.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So at best I am a 50% opted in and 50% opted out consumer based on this two-minute experiment. I suspect I am not a typical user, because I am super informed on GDPR and know exactly what needs to be done in this world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when this choice is placed in front of users &#8211; real users &#8211; then I think none of us are typical. This means publishers will need to create a more direct connection with their customers, something they are increasingly incentivised to do, especially with Facebook deprioritising them in the newsfeed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is also clear is that the entire industry will need to have a strategy for all of that inventory which sits on the outskirts of Consentworld in The Land of Non Consent. I think there is a clear solution for that world too &#8211; but that’s another story, for another day.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have found that you have read through every word of this article and taken nothing in because of the sheer number of uses of the words Consent, Privacy and Cookie, then fear not.

He likes privacy regulations. Honestly.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we accelerate down this headlong rollercoaster ride towards GDPR compliance day in May of this year the industry is scrambling to achieve the nirvana of compliance. And the screams are getting louder.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back in December we were all ‘waiting’ for the Article 29 Working Party to provide ‘guidance’ on the acquisition of Consent as a legal basis for data-driven advertising. December came and went and it didn’t feel to me like we had made a lot of progress as an industry even when the guidance was released.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then came a press release from IAB Europe announcing an industry consent mechanism for meeting the challenges under the GDPR.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On face value it seemed like a Consent silver bullet. The release read: &#8220;The technical mechanism is designed to enable websites, advertisers and their ad technology partners to make more robust disclosures, as well as obtain, record and update consumers’ consent for their personal data to be processed in line with the GDPR.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Moreover, the mechanism enables transmission of user consent choices to the supply chain, increasing accountability in the advertising ecosystem by enabling the creation of consent records and an audit trail.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So to find out more I had a chat with IAB Europe’s Public Policy Officer Chris Hartsuiker, and their Senior Manager, Privacy &amp; Public Policy Matthias Matthiesen, who told me that the organisation has an ongoing working party focusing on Consent because it is such a significant topic and because: “there is such a difference between what the European Union&#8217;s Article 29 Working Party is recommending for Consent and what the IAB Europe believes is acceptable. We needed to present an alternative point of view.&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The IAB are creating a set of standards and mechanisms which will provide an informed way for people to implement Consent solutions. The first of which is a Global Vendor List which will have details like Name, Address, Description of Services, link to Privacy Policy etc. of ecosytem players, and which will be held in a central repository where vendors can keep their information up to date &#8211; to provide transparency to the world.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The second piece is a series of Technical Specifications which focus on how Consent is captured and propagated through the programmatic ecosystem, because if you intend to use Consent you have to make a record of how it was captured &#8211; to demonstrate you had it in the first place. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IAB Europe envisions there will be different ways that Consent can be stored and that Publishers will have their own implementations depending on how they want to operate. A publisher may want to obtain Consent purely for their own benefit, or for a Group of Publishers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a consumer signs up for Consent on one Publisher, that can’t be transferred to another Publisher unless that was clearly outlined at the time of capture. So a consortium of Publishers can share Consent without it being explicitly obtained for that consortia, and if one Publisher does not like that Consent was NOT obtained through this mechanism, they would need to try and ask again for their own benefit &#8211; which may annoy the user.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where there is conflict between different opt-ins on different Publishers and Groups, then the most specific would be considered the ruling Consent.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, publishers will need to explicitly name EVERY downstream Partner that they intend to work with to the consumer, and their Partners’ Partners &#8211; because a founding principle of GDPR is that companies that are unknown to individuals should not have the right to use their personal data without Consent. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will be an implementation choice of the Publisher whether they want to provide opt-in as a catch-all to all Partners, or as  a list of opt-ins to Partners individually. The first does not provide a high level of granularity of user choice so can be considered less privacy-friendly, the second is an enormous list of companies the average user will not have heard of so is not particularly user-friendly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The technical specifications that IAB Europe will be providing will be open source and they are currently finalising the open software licensing with the intention of publishing at the end of January. It will be information on storage format and javascript APIs for Publishers. The proliferation of Consent through the ecosystem will be based around an extension to the Open RTB spec, plus the reference implementation portal will be built and opened for entrants.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have found that you have read through every word of this article and taken nothing in because of the sheer number of uses of the words Consent, Publisher, Partner and Group, then fear not.

Native ad formats advance the objectives of the three most critical parties: publishers, advertisers, and consumers. By displaying advertising that looks and feels like the publisher content, user experience is respected, and consumers respond more favorably to both the advertiser and the publisher, a claim that has been continually proven by both quantitative study and anecdotal feedback.</p>\n<p>The partnership creates new, native-only ad placements on BBC.com sites where TripleLift powered demand could reach BBC.com’s 95.MM monthly unique users globally. “BBC.com is a publisher that brings the scale, quality, and name recognition that we are looking for as native advertising continues to grow,” said Michael Lehman, VP of Supply for TripleLift. “It’s important that we bring high quality names and placements to the advertisers in this competitive marketplace.”</p>\n<p>BBC Advertising has chosen to launch with a Private Marketplace (PMP) focused strategy that provides advertisers with the best control over price, quality, and availability. The comprehensive go-to-market strategy allows their sales team to directly sell this channel while also opening controlled inventory to programmatic buyers in the open exchange. The programmatic exchange delivers native scale for a publisher with significant global presence like BBC.com.</p>\n<p>“It is important to us that our native provider has the scale to match our audience,” said David Goddard, Global Head of Programmatic Trading, BBC Advertising, “TripleLift is among the most innovative SSPs providing us with buyers from every notable demand source in the US, EMEA and APAC. We look forward to working with them.”</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>About TripleLift</strong></p>\n<p>TripleLift is the industry&#8217;s leading programmatic native advertising platform. The company&#8217;s technology allows brands to amplify their content through in-feed native ads that match the unique look and feel of thousands of publishers. Publishers leverage TripleLift&#8217;s technology to create a new revenue stream through monetizing their in-feed inventory.

The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour.</p>\n","title":"This is a standard post with a images slider","uri":"/blog/this-is-a-standard-post-with-a-images-slider/","date":"August 18, 2017","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1","name":"Advertisement"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2","name":"Artistry"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo3","name":"Blog"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo4","name":"Conceptual"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTo0","name":"Standard"},{}]},"featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","localFile":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ad001d53683b7550b2239365a4c45daf/9dc4f/800x650-ph.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ad001d53683b7550b2239365a4c45daf/3e26a/800x650-ph.jpg 200w,\n/static/ad001d53683b7550b2239365a4c45daf/69b79/800x650-ph.jpg 400w,\n/static/ad001d53683b7550b2239365a4c45daf/9dc4f/800x650-ph.jpg 800w","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ad001d53683b7550b2239365a4c45daf/532ec/800x650-ph.avif 200w,\n/static/ad001d53683b7550b2239365a4c45daf/d1398/800x650-ph.avif 400w,\n/static/ad001d53683b7550b2239365a4c45daf/2abe6/800x650-ph.avif 800w","type":"image/avif","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"},{"srcSet":"/static/ad001d53683b7550b2239365a4c45daf/7a016/800x650-ph.webp 200w,\n/static/ad001d53683b7550b2239365a4c45daf/4f042/800x650-ph.webp 400w,\n/static/ad001d53683b7550b2239365a4c45daf/d0f83/800x650-ph.webp 800w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 800px) 800px, 100vw"}]},"width":1000,"height":812.5}}}}},"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},{"id":"cG9zdDoxOTgx","excerpt":"<p>In 2015 Google launched Accelerated Mobile Pages dramatically changing mobile advertising across the board.
