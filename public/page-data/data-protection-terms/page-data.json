Certain capitalized terms used in the DPT and not otherwise defined may be defined in Section 9 below.&nbsp; Any capitalized terms not defined in the DPT have the respective meanings given to them in the Agreement.

If TripleLift reasonably believes that Publisher&#8217;s privacy disclosures or Publisher’s Notice and Choice are not adequate to enable, in a legally compliant and commercially reasonable manner, TripleLift to provide the Services, or Demand Partners to bid for and purchase Inventory, then TripleLift may notify Publisher of its concerns and/or provide a reasonable alternative method. The parties will discuss any changes in good faith.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>4. <strong>Co-operation between the parties</strong>.</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>4.1.

Each party will have in place appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks that are presented by the processing of Personal Data by or on behalf of the parties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>6. <strong>International Transfer</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>6.1. Publisher acknowledges that certain Covered Personal Data that originates in the GDPR Territories may be processed by TripleLift outside the GDPR Territories.

In the event that TripleLift is deemed to process Covered Personal Data for a Business Purpose, it will be regarded as a Service Provider and TripleLift will process such Personal Data solely to provide the Services to Publisher, which do not constitute a CCPA Sale. Neither party receives from the other party any monetary or other valuable consideration for using Personal Data or for sharing Personal Data with the other party. Publisher further acknowledges that to facilitate the TripleLift Services, TripleLift transmits Personal Data to Demand Partners and Publisher may use controls provided by TripleLift to select which Demand Partners may access Publisher’s Inventory under the Services.&nbsp; For any End User or device that opts out and about which Publisher shares Personal Data, Publisher will signal the user opt-out to TripleLift in accordance with Industry Standards, and TripleLift will act as Publisher’s Service Provider with respect to Personal Data from such End User, and as such will limit its retention, use, or disclosure as required under the CCPA.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n<p>8. <strong>Regulatory changes</strong>. If changes to applicable Data Protection Laws, or their interpretation or implementation, arise through legislation, claim or regulator guidance or action, which in TripleLift&#8217;s reasonable opinion make changes to the DPT necessary or prudent, TripleLift may, on written notice to Publisher, make such changes to the DPT, which Publisher agrees will be binding on Publisher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>9. <strong>Definitions</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The terms “Data Controller”, “Data Subject”, “Personal Data”, and “processing” have the meanings given to such terms under Data Protection Laws.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Adequate Country” means a country or territory that is recognized under Data Protection Laws from time to time as providing adequate protection for Personal Data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Business” has the meaning given to such term under the CCPA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Business Purpose” has the meaning given to such term under the CCPA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“CCPA Sale” has the meaning given to the term “sale” under the CCPA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Client” means each third party client on whose behalf Publisher uses the Services or whom Publisher allows to access the Services.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Complaint” means a complaint or request relating to either party’s obligations under Data Protection Laws relevant to this Agreement, including any compensation claim from a Data Subject or any notice, investigation or other action from a Supervisory Authority, consumer or industry body.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Covered Personal Data” means Personal Data (or equivalent term) as such is defined in Data Protection Laws, that relates to End Users, and that TripleLift or Demand Partners process, or that Publisher otherwise causes TripleLift to process, in relation to the Services.
