If you would like information about exercising your rights over data processed in our corporate functions, such as HR and recruiting, or business-to-business marketing, please go <a href=\"/corporate-privacy-policy/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Opt out</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>You are able to make choices about how data about you or your devices is collected and used. To learn more about how our Services collect and use data, see our <a href=\"/platform-privacy-policy/\">privacy policy</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that opting out does not mean you will not get ads. It only affects the type of data that is collected and used in relation to digital advertising, and in fact, after you opt out you may see less relevant and/or more repetitive ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Opting out depends on your browser or device.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Web browsers:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For browsers we offer a cookie-based opt-out. When you opt out in a web browser, an opt-out cookie will be stored in your browser. Later, when our Services see this cookie, the system will know the choice you have made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the opt-out is set, the opt-out is retained, but data previously stored in our Services ages out after about 30 days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some things to keep in mind when using the web-based opt-out:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If you use more than one browser, or browser profile, you will need to opt out on each browser.</li><li>If you clear your cookies, and the opt-out cookie is deleted, you will need to reset the opt-out.</li><li>The opt-out may not function in browsers, such as Safari, that block or delete cookies.</li><li>Even after opting out, you may continue to receive advertising through our services, but those ads may be repetitive or less relevant.</li><li>After you opt out, data we have collected about your browser will be disassociated from your device.</li><li>Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you should renew your opt-out choice.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You may also opt out from other companies that are involved in digital advertising and may also be collecting or processing data on digital content you access. Many of those companies opt-outs are collected together on industry opt out pages. The US-based opt out pages are www.aboutads.info/choices and www.networkadvertising.org/choices. The European based page is www.youronlinechoices.com. In Canada, use youradchoices.ca/choices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can opt-out of receiving ads that are personalized by our clients and partners using our technology by using the opt-out tool below. Once you opt-out, we will no longer use any information from your device and as a result, our clients will not be able to serve you ads that are targeted to your interests using our technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://eb2.3lift.com/optout?rdir=http%3A%2F%2Ftriplelift.com%2Fconsumer-opt-out%2Fcompleted%2F\">TripleLift Cookie Opt-out</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The opt-out operates by placing a cookie on your device that identifies the device as opted out. If you change browsers or computers, or delete the cookies on your computer, you will need to opt-out again. You also can set your browser to notify you when a cookie is being set and to block most cookies, including ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Mobile:</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile device system software such as Apple iOS or Google Play Services provide mechanisms that allow users to opt out of the use of information about their activity in mobile apps to deliver targeted ads to their mobile device. For more information, or to opt out using these mechanisms, consult your device settings (“Opt out of Personalized Ads” on Android devices and “Limit Ad Tracking” on iOS devices). Or, you might also find helpful information on the NAI’s Mobile Choices page linked <a href=\"http://\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a> (though, we are not responsible for the content of that page). We are not able to directly access the Mobile opt-out on devices that offer it, but when our Services receive the mobile opt-out signals, we act on them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>TVs and other devices</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your internet connected device (e.g.&nbsp;a smart TV or a set-top box) may give you the ability to opt out of the use of information for advertising purposes. To determine if your Internet connected device has these options, please visit your device’s settings menu. Because consumer choice mechanisms on internet connected devices differ depending on the device and the service or app you use, we may still receive data after you opt out on your device, and we may or may not receive your opt-out signal. Nevertheless, if we receive data with an opt-out signal, we will act on it according to our understanding of what the opt-out should mean.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may find the NAI’s Internet Connected TV Choices educational page, <a href=\"https://www.networkadvertising.org/internet-connected-tv-choices/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>, offers additional helpful information (though, we are not responsible for the content of that page).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Location Data</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many devices, such as mobile phones, allow you to control access to and use of precise geographic information from your device. For more information, or to opt out using these mechanisms, consult your device settings. Note that when location services have not been enabled in any of your apps, we will still infer data about your imprecise location based on your IP address.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>California Do Not Sell My Personal Information</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>TripleLift does not sell personal information that is collected or used in our Services. However, our customers and partners may use our technology to buy or sell personal information as defined by California law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you visit one of our digital content customers, they may offer a “Do Not Sell” option. When you exercise that option, the digital content provider should, depending on the nature of its business, either not send us personal information at all, or send it to us in association with a signal that indicates your Do Not Sell choice. When we receive data with such a signal, we act on it according to the law and industry standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, you can opt out as described on this page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that because these opt-outs are specific to the device or browser on which they are exercised, you will need to opt out on each browser and device.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Access and Deletion Rights</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, our ability to respond to an access request is limited because we cannot match identified individuals to data that is in our Platform and therefore cannot verify individuals’ identities. As explained in our <a href=\"/platform-privacy-policy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Advertising Technology Platform Privacy Policy</a>, that is because we use pseudonymous data that does not directly identify individuals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, it only collects certain digital identifiers that enable us to recognize your Internet browser or device (each, a “Digital Identifier”).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For that reason, in order for us to honor any requests you submit, we need you to provide us with your Digital Identifiers and certain other information.&nbsp; This is necessary to locate any records we hold associated with your Digital Identifiers. We explain below how to do this, and use this additional information only for the purpose of processing your data protection and privacy requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are your rights?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Residents of some jurisdictions (for example the European Economic Area (“EEA”), the United Kingdom (“UK”), Switzerland, and California), have certain rights available to them under the laws of those jurisdictions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These rights may include the right to request access to, rectify, or request erasure/deletion or portability of, personal information. Residents of these jurisdictions may also have a right to object to, or request that we restrict, processing of their personal information. Where such rights apply, we will comply with requests to exercise these rights in accordance with applicable data protection laws. We will also make efforts to honor such requests even in jurisdictions that do not provide for these rights</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you make a request to access the specific pieces of personal information we hold about you in accordance with applicable law (also known as an “access request“), we will provide the Digital Identifiers of your browser(s) and/or device(s) that TripleLift may store. Additionally, we may also provide you with certain other information that we may have stored and associated with your Digital Identifiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please note, however, that we have a very short retention period for the data we associate with Digital Identifiers. As a result, we may not be able to provide you any records in response to an access request. In such cases, however, we will inform you that we have not been able to locate any records associated with your Digital Identifiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note also, we have a responsibility to verify your identity before we respond to an access request. This is to make sure that we provide a copy of your personal information only to the person who is entitled to it – you. If you wish to make an access request, please contact us directly, with sufficient details for us to verify your identity (as explained below).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How to Exercise a data subject or consumer rights request</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please follow these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 1: Locate Your Digital Identifiers</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order for us to locate relevant records, we will need you to provide us with your Digital Identifiers. You can find your Digital Identifiers as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Web Browsing</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As described in our privacy policy , our Platform operates by using text files called “cookies” that are placed on your device. Some of these cookies include a Digital Identifier. To locate these Digital Identifiers, you can search through your cookies for the cookies named “[__]” and “[__]” (which are set from the [___] domain). The text in each of these cookies is a separate Digital Identifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different cookies are placed on each browser that you use to access the Internet. As a result, if you use multiple browsers (for example, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox), you will need to locate the “[__]” and “[__]” cookies for each browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mobile Devices and other Internet Connected Devices</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, certain mobile devices (for example, mobile phones or tablets using the iOS or Android operating systems) generate a persistent “Advertising Identifier” per device, which, among other things, can be used by third parties, like TripleLift, for purposes of providing you with advertising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On iOS devices, your Advertising Identifier may be referred to as an “IDFA,” “IFA,” or an “ID for Advertising.” On Android devices, your Advertising Identifier may be referred to as an “Advertising ID.” Please follow instructions from your mobile device manufacturer on how to locate your specific Advertising Identifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 2: Verify Your Digital Identifiers</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In order to make sure that we are responding to the correct person, we also will need some supporting proof to demonstrate that the devices that have the Digital Identifiers you located in Step 1 are yours and that the information you are requesting relates to you.&nbsp; For Digital Identifiers stored in cookies, please take a screenshot of each cookie, taking care to make sure that the screenshot shows both the name of the cookie and the full Digital Identifier. For Digital Identifiers located on a mobile device, please take a screenshot of a screen that displays the Digital Identifier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may also request that you respond to a few questions, so that we can appropriately verify your identity. Doing this helps us to validate that you have access to the device on which the Digital Identifiers have been placed (and that you are not an unauthorized third party attempting to “guess” Digital Identifiers).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step 3: Submit to TripleLift</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have located your Digital Identifiers and can provide us with verification of those Digital Identifiers, please contact us with details of the rights you wish to exercise. The easiest way to do so would be submit the relevant information to platformprivacy((at))triplelift((dot))com and include the following information:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your full name</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The region in which you are located at the time you are making your request</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data subject or consumer rights you wish to exercise</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The law(s) under which you are making your request</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A full list of your Digital Identifiers</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Device validation information, as set forth in Step 2</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Identity certification</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also make a data subject rights request by phone by calling TripleLift’s data subject hotline at 1-800-760-9122.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>California.</strong> Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), if you are a California resident, you have rights to request (or have an agent request) that we disclose the following information to you: (1) the categories of personal information we have collected about you, including those we have disclosed for a business purpose and/or sold to third parties; (2) the categories of sources from which your personal information is collected; (3) the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information; (4) the categories of third parties with whom we share and/or have sold your personal information, and for each category of third party, the categories of personal information sold to them; and (5) the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you. Depending on the nature of your request, and whether we can verify it, we will provide all or some subset of the categories listed above.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To exercise your rights, please follow the steps described above.</p>\n","title":"User Rights Policy and Opt Out","slug":"user-rights-policy-and-opt-out","uri":"/user-rights-policy-and-opt-out/","isFrontPage":false,"isPrivacyPage":false,"PageCreativeGallery":{"pageHeading":null,"pageSubheading":null,"topHeading":null,"topSubheading":null},"PageProductOffers":{"headline":"Product Offers","leftHeader":null,"sliderProductOffer":null},"template":{"templateName":"Default"}}},"pageContext":{"uri":"/user-rights-policy-and-opt-out/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["492585110","848497233"]}
