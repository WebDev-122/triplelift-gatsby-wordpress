The UK arm of the IAB just released part one of a set of guidelines to help UK advertisers and publishers make sense of native ad disclosure.  The guidelines provide advertisers, publishers, agencies and advertising technology companies with clear and practical steps to make it easier for consumers to spot native advertising – digital ad formats designed to look and feel like editorial content.</p>\n<p>Two of the key guidelines for native advertising formats are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide consumers with prominently visible <b><i>visual</i></b> cues enabling them to immediately understand they are engaging with marketing content compiled by a third party in a native ad format which isn’t editorially independent <i>(e.g. brand logos or design, such as fonts or shading, clearly differentiating it from surrounding editorial content)</i></li>\n<li>It must be <b><i>labeled</i></b> using wording that demonstrates a commercial arrangement is in place <i>(e.g. ‘paid promotion’ or ‘brought to you by’).</i></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is important that the worldwide market is on the same page with native advertising.  It looks like we are taking the right steps to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past.  But we have a long road ahead of us.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;\t\t</p>\n","title":"Native Advertising Takes Center Stage at IAB Leadership Meeting","uri":"/blog/native-advertising-takes-center-stage-at-iab-leadership-meeting/","date":"February 11, 2015","terms":{"nodes":[{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0Nw==","name":"ad tech"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0OA==","name":"ads"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo0OQ==","name":"advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1MA==","name":"agencies"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMjE=","name":"Annual"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2Mw==","name":"brand marketing"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo4MA==","name":"Branding"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1MQ==","name":"content marketing"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Mw==","name":"digital marketing"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1NA==","name":"Digital Media"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2NA==","name":"display advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMjI=","name":"guidelines"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo5Nw==","name":"iab"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMDI=","name":"insights"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMjM=","name":"Leadership"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMjQ=","name":"Meeting"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Ng==","name":"native"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1Nw==","name":"native ads"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OA==","name":"Native advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo1OQ==","name":"nativeadvertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2MA==","name":"online"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo3MQ==","name":"online advertising"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybTo2Ng==","name":"research"},{"__typename":"WpTag","id":"dGVybToxMjU=","name":"UK"},{"__typename":"WpCategory","id":"dGVybTox","name":"Uncategorized"}]},"featuredImage":null,"PageWeGoBeyondPageOne":{"buttonText":"Watch Video","footerText":null,"headerBrief":"","headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","videoCta":null,"stops":null,"pageLogo":null},"PageWeGoBeyondPageTwo":{"animationDuration":500,"headerBrief":null,"headerHeading":"Journey  of an Impression","linkToPageOne":"/go/we-go-beyond/","qualityCards":null,"megaCardHeaders":null,"qualityCardColor":"#f15c2c","qualityHeader":"Quality","resourceBody":"Browser our resources below to see how programmatic advertising is different with TripleLift","resourceHeadline":"TripleLift Resources","resultHeader":"Results","resultsCardColor":"#ed79b0","scaleCardColor":"#fcb316","scaleHeader":"Scale","trackingCodes":"<!-- Hotjar Tracking Code for www.triplelift.com -->\r\n<script> (function(h,o,t,j,a,r){ h.hj=h.hj::function(){(h.hj.q=h.hj.q::[]).push(arguments)}; h._hjSettings={hjid:2260882,hjsv:6}; a=o.getElementsByTagName('head')[0]; r=o.createElement('script');r.async=1; r.src=t+h._hjSettings.hjid+j+h._hjSettings.hjsv; a.appendChild(r); })(window,document,'https://static.hotjar.com/c/hotjar-','.js?sv='); </script>","resultsCards":null,"pageLogo":null}},"previous":{"uri":"/blog/print-taking-a-page-from-the-digital-playbook/","title":"Print Taking a Page From The Digital Playbook"},"next":{"uri":"/blog/5-ways-to-deflate-your-native-advertising-strategy/","title":"5 Ways to Deflate Your Native Advertising Strategy"}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDoxMzQ5","previousPostId":"cG9zdDoxMzUw","nextPostId":"cG9zdDoxMzQ4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["848497233"]}
